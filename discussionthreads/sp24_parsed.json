We have looked at the FAQ where it mentions Matrix_at() and we have referenced lecture notes about pointers and how to use them when writing code for testing Matrix_at().   We seem to be having the most issues when we try to assign a value through a pointer we created using Matrix_at() (the non-constant function) and when we try to use that pointer when calling another function (Matrix_column) (however, we were able to use a pointer made with Matrix_at() when calling Matrix_column() in a separate test function). The code stops running at this point and the terminal says it is experiencing a segmentation fault, but I don't think we are accessing anything out of bounds. I'm struggling to find out if the issue is with some part of the test case I've written, Matrix_at(), or Matrix_column().  Sorry if I am being unclear, I am really lost on what the issue is, so I'm struggling to articulate the problems I've found. Do you know what the issue might be or what issues I should be looking for in our code?

We received 10/10 in this category on a submission made May 19th at about 7pm. After that, we removed one test within a larger test function that was getting a false positive according to the autograder (I know that I removed only the part that was getting a false positive because I stopped getting that message for later submissions without changing the other parts of that test function.) However, in spite of only making the changes that were causing their own issues, our score dropped to 2/10. Even if those 2-3 tests were catching autograder bugs, I don't understand how taking out those total 10 lines of code (including cout statements) could have made us lose 8 points on the autograder.  I have even submitted the same file twice (copy pasted the entire file from the autograder submission that got 10/10 -- only taking out the part that had previously received a false positive -- and resubmitted it today, May 20th at about 8:50pm, alongside my other, updated, files) and our score is still stuck at 2/10 for the Matrix_cpp.tests. There is only one unique aspect to the test cases that were causing false positives, so I reasonably think that that unique aspect must also be what the Autograder is giving us points for. However, I don't know how to continue submitting those test cases if they are giving us false positives.   Is there something I am missing? Why are we scoring so low on the autograder's tests for Matrix_tests.cpp after briefly scoring 10/10? Should we continue submitting files with test cases that are returning false positives just to get the Matrix_tests points? Will submitting files with false positives harm our score in the end?

      "I would take a second look at the unit testing framework. I am not sure how you caught 10/10 bugs the first time around since you weren't using the assert statements needed to signal to the program that there was an issue in that submission. After looking at your test file there are some issues with the way you structure your tests. I submitted one of the files you submitted to the AG that got a 10/10 and got a 0/10 myself. So there is something strange going on.\n\nMy guess is, the only bugs you are catching in your latest submission are the ones in which the buggy instructor solution intentionally goes out of bounds, hence violating the RME and failing the assert statements inside the Matrix_at() function in Matrix.cpp, for example.\n\nWhat I would do is modify all your test cases to use ASSERT_TRUE(), ASSERT_EQUAL(), etc. like we require in the unit testing framework. This is the way you are supposed to catch bugs in this class. While print statements are useful for local testing, im pretty sure that the autograder is only checking for failures in the unit test framework.
