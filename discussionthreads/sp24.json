Please keep the followups related to questions in this post only.\n\nQ: I get this error when trying to run VSCode on WSL (error starting the pipe progam):\n\nA: Try changing:\n\n“pipeProgram”: “c:\\windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe”,\n\nto\n\n“pipeProgram”: “/mnt/c/Windows/System32/bash.exe”,\n\nin the launch.json\n\nQ: I’m trying to debug my project with VSCode on Mac, but it’s skipping all my breakpoints. What do I do?\n\nA: This is a known bug in the Microsoft C/C++ extension. Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension with the following steps:\n\nIn VSCode, go to the Extensions tab and search for “CodeLLDB”\n\n\n\nSet your `launch.json` configuration to the following:\n\n\n\n{ “name”: “(lldb) Launch”,\n\n“type”: “lldb”,\n\n“request”: “launch”,\n\n“program”: “${workspaceFolder}/stats_tests.exe”,\n\n“args”: [],\n\n“cwd”: “${workspaceFolder}”,\n\n}\n\n\nQ: VSCode/macOS: Why am I unable to view console output?\n\nA: Try installing the `CodeLLDB` extension: https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_vscode.html#macos-1\n\nQ: I haven’t worked with vectors before - are there any recommended resources?\n\nA: Check out the project 1 vector tutorial https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/vector.html\n\nQ: My output is not printing out…what might be causing this? I am getting an “Invalid Read” or “Segmentation Fault”…what might be causing this?\n\nA: This is caused by an “Access-out-of-bounds” error. You are indexing past the valid elements of a vector and reading some unknown data! This is undefined behavior that computers handle differently (which is why this may fail on the autograder but not locally). Re-read your function and think about where it could index out of bounds. Write some test cases that test the bounds of the vector to help you catch the bug!",

        "text": "Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2. Please keep the followups related to FAQs in this post only.\n\nProject Tips:\n\nWrite clear code! This is especially important for this project, remember:\nMatrix width = # of columns\nMatrix height = # of rows\nInstead of using variables like \"i\" and \"j\" in your for-loops, consider using \"row\" and \"col\" so you don't get confused!\n\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ: Am I required to use traversal by pointer?\nA: No. You are allowed to, but not required to use traversal by pointer in this project. You should choose to traverse by index/pointer based on what makes sense to you logically.\n\nQ: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected? \nA: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 30 seconds. Double check that you're not copying Matrix/Image objects without using pointers, looping unnecessarily, or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/p2-cv/perf.html\n\n\nQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function? \nA: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.\n\nQ: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix-\u003ewidth directly?\nA: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.\n\nQ: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?\nA: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!\n\nQ: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?\nA: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.\n\nQ: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive? \nA: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5. \n\nQ: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?\nA: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.\n\n\nQ: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file. \nA: Double check your Image_init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.\n\nQ: I have a small pixel mismatch in my crabster and horse processing tests. \nA: You may be accessing out-of-bounds locations in a Matrix or Image. Add assertions in your Matrix_at(), Image_get_pixel(), and Image_set_pixel() functions. If those assertions fail, run via your debugger and check exactly why they're failing. You may also consider enabling the address sanitizer to check for other sorts of undefined behavior. \n\nQ: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?\n\nA: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give is to brainstorm more edge cases. \n\nQ: What is a false positive?\n\nA: A false positive is when a correct instructor solution failed an assertion in your test case. This means that there is a logical issue in your test case. If you have a false positive test case that passes locally for you, this same logical issue may be present in your implementation. Come to office hours if you would like more in depth help on it!\n\nQ: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.\n\nA: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: https://eecs280staff.github.io/p1-stats/setup_xcode.html#run\n\n\nHappy coding!",

Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbreak/\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file.\u003c/bold\u003e \u003cbreak/\u003eA: Double check your Image_init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: I have a small pixel mismatch in my crabster and horse processing tests.\u003c/bold\u003e \u003cbreak/\u003eA: You may be accessing out-of-bounds locations in a Matrix or Image. Add \u003cbold\u003eassertions\u003c/bold\u003e in your Matrix_at(), Image_get_pixel(), and Image_set_pixel() functions. If those assertions fail, run via your debugger and check exactly why they're failing. You may also consider enabling the \u003clink href=\"https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_asan.html\"\u003eaddress sanitizer\u003c/link\u003e to check for other sorts of undefined behavior. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA: Sorry! We don't share what test cases the AG is looking for. The best advice we can give is to brainstorm more edge cases. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: What is a false positive?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA: A false positive is when a correct instructor solution failed an assertion in your test case. This means that there is a logical issue in your test case. If you have a false positive test case that passes locally for you, this same logical issue may be present in your implementation.

The code stops running at this point and the terminal says it is experiencing a segmentation fault, but I don't think we are accessing anything out of bounds.

After that, we removed one test within a larger test function that was getting a false positive according to the autograder (I know that I removed only the part that was getting a false positive because I stopped getting that message for later submissions without changing the other parts of that test function.) However, in spite of only making the changes that were causing their own issues, our score dropped to 2/10. Even if those 2-3 tests were catching autograder bugs, I don't understand how taking out those total 10 lines of code (including cout statements) could have made us lose 8 points on the autograder.\n\nI have even submitted the same file twice (copy pasted the entire file from the autograder submission that got 10/10 -- only taking out the part that had previously received a false positive -- and resubmitted it today, May 20th at about 8:50pm, alongside my other, updated, files) and our score is still stuck at 2/10 for the Matrix_cpp.tests. There is only one unique aspect to the test cases that were causing false positives, so I reasonably think that that unique aspect must also be what the Autograder is giving us points for. However, I don't know how to continue submitting those test cases if they are giving us false positives. \n\nIs there something I am missing? Why are we scoring so low on the autograder's tests for Matrix_tests.cpp after briefly scoring 10/10? Should we continue submitting files with test cases that are returning false positives just to get the Matrix_tests points? Will submitting files with false positives harm our score in the end?\n\nThank you",

There will be a project overview session coming up, please keep an eye out for that announcement soon!\n\nFAQs:\n\nQ: I’ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?\n\nA: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of “EECS 280 Euchre”. You can reference the Euchre Social slides linked here. Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc\n\n0:33 Dealing\n\n1:55 The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1\n\n5:35 Making Trump Round 2\n\n7:20 Leading the First Trick\n\n8:20 The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick\n\n10:58 Deciding who Wins the First Trick\n\n11:24 Leading the Second Trick\n\n12:00 Playing the Rest of the Hand\n\n20:30 Scoring\n\n21:23 Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending\n\nQ: What do I have to submit to pass the checkpoint?\n\nThe checkpoint includes all the files except the driver (Card.cpp, Card_tests.cpp, Pack.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp). It will make up 0.5% of your overall course grade.\n\nQ: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?\n\nYou are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So within your implementations of the class’s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!\n\nThis is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.\n\nQ: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?\n\nNote that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the \u003c operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.\n\nSimilarly: Q: I’m getting a compiler error related to swap?\n\nThis is the same question as the one above.\n\nQ: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?\n\nThis means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you’re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you’re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.\n\nQ: Why won’t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?\n\nClick on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme \u003e Options \u003e Enable “Custom Working Directory” and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.\n\nQ: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?\n\nFollow this link and click on your specific IDE, then click on the “Arguments and options” subsection.\n\nQ: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?\n\nYes, according to the spec: “First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.”\n\nQ: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?\n\nNo, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.\n\nQ: How do I test player member functions such as add_card() and add_and_discard()?\n\nYou can call play_card() repeatedly to make a player play their whole hand, and then you can check if the contents of their hand was what you expected. (Note that you cannot test by adding to the Player interface, since test cases only have access to the interface defined in Player.hpp.)\n\nQ: I am failing the euchre_test01 public test. Why is Edsger/Fran/Gabriel/Herb supposed to play the cards in euchre_test01.out.correct?\n\n\n\nCheck out the Euchre Test 01 Explanation, which is linked from the project spec.",

That's where enums come in. Enums are the best of both worlds.\n\n\nWith enums, we can store and use the values of an enum efficiently because enums have a default underlying data type of int.

Note that what \u003ccode\u003eptr_ptr\u003c/code\u003e was pointing to was not changed, it was only the \u003citalic\u003evalue\u003c/italic\u003e of \u003ccode\u003eptr_ptr\u003c/code\u003e that was changed (\u003ccode\u003eptr\u003c/code\u003e)\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimage src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/DvHOxCRqMSffI148glK2wqZ1\" width=\"743\" height=\"437.5736160188457\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eFinally, we subtract \u003ccode\u003e*ptr_ptr - ptr\u003c/code\u003e .

This is the thread for Project 4 FAQ’s.\n\nQ: What is a linked list/iterator?\n\nA: A linked list is another kind of container and an iterator is an object used to traverse and access elements in a container. You can refer to the lecture slides or the class notes (https://eecs280staff.github.io/notes/) if you have any questions.\n\nQ: Why am I getting an error related to accessing a private member of Iterator in a List function?\n\nA: By default private members of the nested Iterator class are not accessible to the List class. The solution is friendship! We’ll be covering friend declarations in the Iterator lecture.\n\nQ: Should I test the destructor/How do I test the destructor?\n\nA: You should write tests for every function that you can. You’re not responsible for testing the destructor in your test cases, but you should use a tool like the address sanitizers to ensure that your code isn’t leaking memory. You shouldn’t call the destructor explicitly! The compiler does so automatically when the object dies.\n\nQ: Why am I getting a segfault/undefined behavior?\n\nA: In general, a common cause for segfaults and undefined behavior in this project is uninitialized pointers. Make sure whenever you create a pointer variable (like first, last, or the members of a Node) and even after you delete the pointer that it is given a clear value. Use your visual debugger as well as address sanitizers to help ensure every pointer is set to the correct value.\n\nQ: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?\n\nA: Double check that you haven’t added any public functions or made one that was originally declared private, public. Also, double check that you’ve not put using namespace std in a header file. Also, you can’t compare an Iterator with a pointer.\n\nQ: On the style check I’m getting a “memory is allocated but not initialized” error whenever I create a Node. But I’m initializing my Node data member variables in the lines directly following. How do I fix this?\n\nA: This occurs because the style checker sees that you create your Node on one line, but is not smart enough to check the following lines to see that you initialize the members of the newly created Node. This can be solved in a few different ways.\n\nDefault constructing your members then initializing them.\n\n    Node* n = new Node{};\n    n-\u003edatum = datum;\n    ...\n\nUsing brace initialization to create the new node.\n\n    Node* n = new Node{next_in, prev_in, datum};\n\nCreating a default constructor for Node.\n\nWe recommend options 1 or 2, since they are easiest to implement and integrate into your existing code. Option 3 is a little more complex, but good practice.\n\nHappy coding!",

You’re not responsible for testing the destructor in your test cases, but you should use a tool like the address sanitizers to ensure that your code isn’t leaking memory. You shouldn’t call the destructor explicitly! The compiler does so automatically when the object dies.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Why am I getting a segfault/undefined behavior?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA: In general, a common cause for segfaults and undefined behavior in this project is uninitialized pointers. Make sure whenever you create a pointer variable (like first, last, or the members of a Node) and even after you delete the pointer that it is given a clear value. Use your visual debugger as well as \u003clink href=\"https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_asan.html\"\u003eaddress sanitizers\u003c/link\u003e to help ensure every pointer is set to the correct value.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Why does my test case compile on CAEN, but not on the Autograder?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA: Double check that you haven’t added any public functions or made one that was originally declared private, public. Also, double check that you’ve not put using namespace std in a header file. Also, you can’t compare an Iterator with a pointer.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: On the style check I’m getting a “memory is allocated but not initialized” error whenever I create a Node. But I’m initializing my Node data member variables in the lines directly following. How do I fix this?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA: This occurs because the style checker sees that you create your Node on one line, but is not smart enough to check the following lines to see that you initialize the members of the newly created Node. This can be solved in a few different ways.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003clist style=\"ordered\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eDefault constructing your members then initializing them.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cpre\u003e    Node* n = new Node{};\n    n-\u0026gt;datum = datum;\n    ...\u003c/pre\u003e\u003clist style=\"ordered\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eUsing brace initialization to create the new node.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cpre\u003e    Node* n = new Node{next_in, prev_in, datum};\u003c/pre\u003e\u003clist style=\"ordered\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eCreating a default constructor for Node.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eWe recommend options 1 or 2, since they are easiest to implement and integrate into your existing code.

        "text": "Q: I've never worked with maps before. Where can I get a crash course about map functionality?\n\nA: Staff last semester made a p5 walkthrough video! Check it out here! In addition, another staff member made this video a few years ago detailing a general overview of what they are and how you can use them. In addition here is a playlist for additional help related to p5.\n\nQ: Should I use my Map.hpp implementation in the driver?\n\nA: DO NOT DO THIS. Your implementation of Map is inefficient, and will cause problems down the road. Use the standard library implementation of map instead. (#include \u003cmap\u003e) Great documentation can be found at http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/\n\nQ: I want to test if an Iterator points to a nullptr, how can I do this?\n\nA: You're probably trying to compare the iterator to nullptr like this: ASSERT_EQUAL(iter, nullptr);. Because these two aren't of the same type, the unit testing framework will probably complain. Instead see if you can compare two objects of the same type - Iterator - which have the same value.\n\n \n\nQ: What is less? What is std::less\u003cT\u003e? How do I use less? \n\nA: less is a private member variable of BST.\n\nIt is an instance of a comparator class whose type is Compare. Compare is a template type. std::less\u003cT\u003e is a functor class in the stl that compares two elements of type T using the \u003c operator. By default, Compare will be std::less\u003cT\u003e.\n\nIn the BinarySearch_compile_check.cpp, there is an example of a BST with the default Compare and a BST with a custom comparator. \n\n\n\nIn the first case, the template will be instantiated like \n\nNode *root;\nstd::less\u003cint\u003e less;\n\nIn the second case, the template will be instantiated like \n\nNode *root;\nDuckWealthLess less;\n\nQ: What could be a cause of incorrect accuracy? \n\nA: Make sure you're properly handling duplicate words. Make sure ties are properly handled. Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type. Check our test_small explanation for a breakdown of log-probability calculations.\n\nQ: Why do I get -inf when I compute a natural log?\n\nA: Make sure you are not doing integer division. If you compute log(1 / 3), the division 1 / 3 gets truncated to 0. Instead, cast the divisor or dividend to a double: log(1 / static_cast\u003cdouble\u003e(3)).\n\nQ: How do I record \"For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w\"? \n\nA: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class.\n\nQ: Why do my test cases compile on CAEN but not the autograder?\n\nA: Double check that you haven't broken the public interface and added a public function. Also, do not put \"using namespace std\" in a header file.\n\nQ: What's a csvstream and how do I use it? \n\nA: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream.\n\n \n\nQ: Do we need to check for duplicates in our check_sorting_invariants_impl?\n\nA: Your check_sorting_invariants_impl checks for a valid BST. A tree with duplicates is not a valid binary search tree. The most definitive and unambiguous description of the invariant you need to check for is described in the sorting invariants section of the spec. To be extra clear, if you were to call check_sorting_invariants on a tree that has duplicates in the right subtree, it should return false.\n\n \n\nQ: VSCode syntax highlighting is breaking on BinarySearchTree.hpp and Map.hpp!\n\nA: This appears to be a bug in VSCode 1.33 regarding default template parameters. We've found a few workarounds, probably the simplest of which is to add a comment to the template declaration:\n\n\n\nQ: How fast does my code need to run?\n\nA: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case.\n\nQ: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?\n\nA: Common sources of slowness include:\n\nProcessing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).\n\nIterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().\n\nPassing strings or containers by value.\n\nIterating by value in a range-based for loop.\n\nQ: How can I check if a node equals nullptr? How can I set a node to nullptr?\n\nA: You can check if a node is nullptr by: ”node_ptr == nullptr” or “!node_ptr”. You can create a node that is nullptr by doing “Node* node_ptr = nullptr”.\n\nQ: What does “no matching function call” mean?\n\nA: This error means that some of your types or parameters to a function call are wrong. Let’s take a function like the vector pushback function, which is used like this “vec.pushback(5)”. If you tried to call “vec.pushback()” it would get a no matching function call because there is no vector pushback function that doesn’t take in any parameters. This same logic applies to constructors. Check the error to see what function is being improperly called and what parameters it takes.\n\n \n\nQ: What is a false positive?\n\nA: A false positive is when the test case passed on your code, however, it your code is still buggy. The test case passed because there was a logical error in your test case so that it wouldn’t reveal the bug in your code. If you have one of these errors, I would suggest re-evaluating the logic of your test case. Come to office hours if you would like more in depth help on it!\n\n#pinazzapostclassifier",

If you tried to call “vec.pushback()” it would get a no matching function call because there is no vector pushback function that doesn’t take in any parameters. This same logic applies to constructors. Check the error to see what function is being improperly called and what parameters it takes.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: What is a false positive?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eA: A false positive is when the test case passed on your code, however, it your code is still buggy. The test case passed because there was a logical error in your test case so that it wouldn’t reveal the bug in your code. If you have one of these errors, I would suggest re-evaluating the logic of your test case. Come to office hours if you would like more in depth help on it!\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e#pinazzapostclassifier\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

On canvas it says I got a 0 for lab 9, but I definitely attended which my team must remember because we all said goodbye as it was their last lab of the semester and it says 10/10 on gradescope.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eIncluding this lab, my average for the class goes from an 89.6 to a 90.17.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eCould this please be looked into?\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThanks,\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eRashne\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",
