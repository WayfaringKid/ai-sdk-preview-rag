# **Question 0**: Hi,   For project 1, are we supposed to rename two_sample.cpp.starter to two_sample.cpp? I saw on the autograder it requires us to submit a file named two_sample.cpp but when downloaded from the starter files it is originally named two_sample.cpp.stater. I saw the instructions for renaming the stats_tests.cpp.starter  and have done that. 

**Answer**: In the project spec here it says "You may have already renamed files like two_sample.cpp.starter to two_sample.cpp" so I assume that means you're supposed to rename it yourself.




# **Question 1**: For the first function where we have to count the number of elements in our vector v, can we just write "return v.size();"? 

**Answer**: Yes, this would work.


# **Question 2**: Hello,  Is the maximum score for project one on the autograder 9 points?  Thanks,  Matt

**Answer**: That is the maximum score among the public tests. However, there are private test cases that you won't know if they have passed or not until after the deadline. So, make sure to test your code and convince yourself it works!


# **Question 3**: As I was thinking of edge cases for data sets, I thought about data sets that are empty. Do we need to handle empty vectors sent to our Stats functions? If so, what should the return value, for example, median() be for an empty data set?   Additionally, the print_descriptive_stats() function says it requires a data set of at least 2 elements. Should the function simply return if a data set of size 1 or 0 is run with it?  Thanks!  

**Answer 0**: I believe that most of the functions require that the dataset not be empty. You can see stats.hpp for the RMEs.

If it's in the requires clause of the function you can either put an assert to make sure that it follows the requires clause. Or you can just assume it wouldn't be called with a size of 1 or 0.
**Answer 1**: Lecture 2 (Async) states the preferable test cases on module 10 (the last one)

It states that for empty vectors you must place assert(!v.empty()) in the function definition and not use this as a test case.

Again, this was stated verbatim in lecture 2.


# **Question 4**: Are we going to be graded on our comments in our code? Will we lose points if we don't put comments in our code?

**Answer**: Nope, you are just graded on your functionality and presence of test cases. However, it is good practice to add comments, so I'd recommend you still do so for readability.


# **Question 5**: I am currently stuck on the final part of project 1 (two_samples). On my computer, my output matches with the correct output but on autograder, my output is something different. I tried looking for undefined behavior but couldn't find any issues with my code. Is there something wrong that is causing a different output on autograder than my system? Thank you!  

**Answer**: It seems to me like this could be an issue with your seed for the bootstrap function, the spec mentions that we have to seed the function the same way as the auto grader will. If you seeded it incorrectly, everything would look right on your computer but the confidence interval would be different on the auto grader


# **Question 6**: When trying to debug a specific function in stats.cpp, I followed the guide posted (which worked for files that had main function and could be converted to .exe)  But for stats.cpp whenever I try to configure and launch Json it says that its not in executable format, and I cannot make it into one since the terminal gives me an error.   How do I get the debugger to function on stats.cpp?

**Answer**: You can call the function you want to debug in stats_tests.cpp and configure stats_tests.exe.




# **Question 7**: Lets assume project 1 is broken down into 3 to dos  stats.cpp tests.cpp two_sample.cpp  Assume I ifnished stats.cpp and tests. cpp but not two_sample.cpp  Can i check the two files I did through autograder, make sure all is good then move on to two_sample? or do all files have to be checked together?  Thank you.

**Answer**: For the autograder, you should always submit all of the files, but they do not necessarily need to be fully implemented. You will just receive feedback that your implementations are not producing the correct output if you have not finished functions in a file. 

We encourage submitting as many times as you can/need, even if only partially finished! Any feedback is typically helpful!




# **Question 8**: Are we allowed to use the code from the spec to stub our functions (i.e., there is code provided for stubbing all functions in stats.cpp)? Also, are we allowed to use the code in the spec for the sum function?  I am not sure how the write the function stubs or code for sum() without it looking like the code already provided in the spec.

**Answer 0**: You are welcome to use anything that is given to you in the spec, whether its for function stubs or implementations. Code provided in the spec is usually a great jumping off place to get started on the projects!


**Answer 1**: Yes, you can use any code that we provide you with - whether it is in the spec, or in the lecture notes or the lecture slides or anything the profs share or discuss in class.


# **Question 9**: I was wondering what "undefined behavior check" means in the autograder?

**Answer**: It means program behavior is unpredictable due to actions that violates certain rules. Two common causes are accessing memory outside array bounds or dividing by zero. You can also check out this tutorial to detect undefined behavior.




# **Question 10**: I am trying to debug my code (I'm using VS code). However, it looks like my debugger is also evaluating lines that are commented out (both normal comments and code that is commented out). How do I prevent this?

**Answer**: Did you remember to save and recompile?


# **Question 11**: When implementing the descriptive  stats function, do I just copy the layout in the spec?  ex> Group A: weight | food = 1count = 5sum = 52.3mean = 10.46stdev = 0.838451median = 10.1min = 9.6max = 11.5 0th percentile = 9.6 25th percentile = 9.9 50th percentile = 10.1 75th percentile = 11.2  Or do i make my own?

**Answer**: Yeah, i think its actually pretty important that you use the exact layout in the spec, since the auto grader will check that it is exactly the same, down to spaces. The spec also mentions that you can use a console command to check if your output is exactly the same, which could be helpful


# **Question 12**: When I submit two_sample.cpp to the autograder I get the error "p1_library.hpp: No such file or directory". I'm confused because I only edited the function stubs in two_sample, and I didn't have any similar issues with the other two files

**Answer**: It should be #include "library.hpp", which is what's provided in the starter file.




# **Question 13**: I am just wondering how can I handle the invalid input such as the size of the vector is zero or invalid p value. I currently use exit(0) function to abort. But in the test if the program abort for invalid input then the program can no longer test the following situations.

**Answer**: Both the situations you've mentioned are a part of the requires clause, meaning those cases don't necessarily have to be covered. You can use an assert() statement as shown in Lecture 2 slide 45 to handle it, rather than exit(0). 


# **Question 14**: In stats.cpp for example, would we have to assert that the user won't give a vector that doesnt make sense? in the .hpp file it only requires it to not be empty  do I have to assert (or make a test case against) the user inputing a vector filled with strings for example? In lecture two it was stated that test cases where the user is specifically trying to be malicious are not needed in this course, does this fall under that?  

**Answer**: The header file function declarations state that the vector data type is double, meaning you don't have to test for a vector of strings. 


# **Question 15**: It doesn't look like there are any private cases for two_sample.cpp on autograder, so does that mean that passing the public tests is enough and we don't need to write our own test cases for that one?  

**Answer**: We always recommend testing the functionality, but you're correct that there are no private test cases for two sample


# **Question 16**: Hi I was just wondering if we needed to read in data for the "v" vector in stats.cpp, or if it's already been done in a another part or is it created by us?

**Answer**: stats.cpp is where you define and implement functions that will be used by other programs (taken from stats.hpp header file).

You implement functions using the parameter "v" vector, each function just operates on the parameter directly.
I dont know what you mean by "read in", but vector V just assumes a vector with values (floating point, "doubles") and is passed into the function.



# **Question 17**: 1. When I test a function, is it worth testing for cases where data is not covered by the epsilon range of error? (for relevant functions.)  For example if my epsilon range of error is (as its used in spec, copy pasted) 0.00001 so five decimal places, is it needed to test for datasets with numbers like 0.0000000001? or is that not necessary?   2. When I test for cases like percentile, is it necessary to use extremely specific decimal numbers like 0.34331442? Or not? If the answer is not a No, then does that case also have to fall under the epsilon range of error?

**Answer**: There is no need to test the case with too many digits after the decimal point. Setting an epsilon threshold means that we allow those cases to fail. It's also not necessary to use specific numbers. The goal is to make the program work for all numbers, and the way to ensure that is using generic/random test cases.


# **Question 18**: I've downloaded all of the starter files for Project 1, but many of the files have a Zone Identifier, is it safe to delete these files, or should I keep them?    

**Answer**: The zone identifier files were likely created when moving the files to WSL, so I believe they should be safe to delete. 


# **Question 19**: Hello,  I see that some people are already submitting test cases to Autograder for Project 1. My only C++ experience is from ENGR101, 2.5 years ago now, and I hardly remember anything. I'm looking at the Project 1 specs and don't know how to begin any of it. Am I already behind, or have we just not learned this yet?  If I am behind, what should I do?  Thanks  

**Answer 0**: Lecture 2 explain a lot of what you need to do/ how it all works.


**Answer 1**: Don't panic! You're doing fine. Project 1 is intended to get everyone up to speed on C++ given that everyone has very different levels of experience with the language. Today's lecture should help, and if you need further help getting started, come to office hours! They are typically pretty empty this far before a project deadline. To get started, I'd say first focus on getting things set up, then understanding the different pieces of the spec. Then you can start trying to code things out.


# **Question 20**: I want just some general clarification since this is all a little new to me. So practically we are making a program that fills in the blanks with the files that are given, so for example we are completing functions like in stats.hpp and using functions from library.cpp to return the output file like cat.out.correct? And then testing a lot more cases like what was given in the cat.csv and the test the HCMST data set?  

**Answer**: Yes. You want to create a stats.cpp file and implement the functions listed in stats.hpp. That will complete the statistics library section of the spec. Then in two_sample.cpp you can use the functions created in stats.cpp to implement the functions according to their RMEs in two_sample.cpp. 

You shouldn't have to use library.cpp in stats.cpp.  You can see that some of the functions are used in two_sample.cpp . Let me know if you have any other questions!




# **Question 21**: For my standard deviation in stats.cpp, I keep getting this error, and I don't know where to start on figuring out what I'm doing wrong. Google says it could be a memory issue, but I'm not quite sure what fixing that entails.

**Answer**: It means that your code for the stdev function is not returning the correct value during the public test. the almost_equal function is basically checking that your function returns an answer within .0001 of the correct answer. I would use the debugger (or cout statements) to check what your function is outputting and how that compares to the actual answer (which is 1).


# **Question 22**: Besides needing to insert assert(!v.empty()) in functions that require a vector that's not empty, there's no need to write test cases with empty vectors, right?   

**Answer 0**: It wouldn't hurt to have some that tests the behaviors of an empty vector as well, as they represent valid test cases
**Answer 1**: If your Requires clause states that the vector must not be empty, then you are not required to handle cases which break the Requires clause. So, you don't need to have test cases to test what happens when the Requires clause is violated, because thats essentially undefined behavior.


# **Question 23**: When using a for statement, is it necessary for me to loop through a vector with size_t or can I just use an int I variable instead? I also just don't really understand why I would make a size_t variable in the first place...?

**Answer**: Great question! The size_t type is an unsigned integer (meaning it is never negative) that is guaranteed to be large enough to reflect the size of the biggest thing in memory. An int is commonly 32 bits while size_t is 64 bits, thus an int may not be large enough to iterate through a big data object. It is safer/good practice to use size_t for the purposes of iterating through a vector because should a programmer make some mistake, having the size_t type there may help you catch that mistake (e.g. imagine you want to decrement a variable when iterating through a vector but you accidentally decrement out of bounds--however, a size_t var can't be negative). 




# **Question 24**: Are the test cases we implement in stats_tests.cpp graded directly? I understand the test cases we write are intended to check for edge cases in our stats.cpp code, which is graded directly by the autograder. However, is our actually stats_test.cpp file graded? If so, what for?   

**Answer**: Edit since the previous answer was incorrect:
The stats_tests file will only be graded on the presence of test cases, not on catching "bugs". The latter type of testing is done on project 2 and beyond. 

For this project, we are only checking for completion in the stats_tests file, although we encourage writing your own tests as this helps with catching the private test cases (and it's good practice!!).




# **Question 25**: In the private test cases, the percentile function in the autograder is looking for 2 test cases, so do I just have to write 2 test cases even though I could have an upper edge case, a lower edge case, and a normal case, a total of 3 possible cases? If I just write 2, would I lose points if the autograder was looking for the 3rd possible test case? Furthermore, in specs, it says that we must at least write one test case for each function, but the autograder has stats test median 1,2,3 and test percentile 1,2 etc. which makes me even more confused on how many test cases I need to write.   

**Answer**: For the private test cases, we will be testing your code against a certain number of test cases to grade your functions. This is separate from the tests you have to write.

For the private test cases, make sure your code is correct. To earn points for your testcases, feel free to write as many test cases you want-- writing a test case for each function is enough to get full points. In this project the test cases are mainly for your benefit. We will only be checking that your tests exist, not if they catch any instructor bugs (see #60 for more info). 


# **Question 26**: Hello,  What order of subtraction is needed to calculate the difference in means for data_A and data_B? Is it (mean of resample of data_A) - (mean of resample of data_B) or the other way?  Also, what should we use for the iteration number (sample_num) in the implementation? Is it the size of data_A/B?

**Answer**: "Difference between groups A and B" is meant to imply A - B!


# **Question 27**: When running the file, the output file matches the cats.out.correct file, however in the autograder it stops at 100th percentile and gives this error:

**Answer**: Based on the error code, it looks like you are having an out-of-bounds error. This happens if you have a vector v of length 5, but are trying to access v[5]. Since indexes start at 0, the maximum index you can access would be v[4]. 




# **Question 28**: Hi! Can we assume the two vectors used in the filter function will be the same size? I know that would be the most logical, but I'm not sure if we are supposed to account for cases that they are different lengths.  

**Answer**: Yes, you can assume that because the Requires clause says v and criteria have the same number of elements.


# **Question 29**: Regarding the following note above the filter function declaration in the stats.hpp file:  Note: For this function, compare values to the criteria using ==.  Is this suggesting we should do: target==criteria[i]  Instead of: abs(target-criteria[i]) < epsilon  Despite the fact that the second option is what we were told to use generally when comparing doubles? 

**Answer**: Correct, you should be using == in the filter function because we are checking for exact matches. The rounding error should only happen when you're testing the stdev() function, in which case you should use option 2.




# **Question 30**: I found there is some style checking tool offered, but I cannot figure out whether project 1 requires style?

**Answer**: "We will grade your code on functional correctness and the presence of test cases." - P1 spec sheet.






# **Question 31**: I'm currently working on the stats.cpp file, and I was wondering if using v.at() is preferred over v[] when accessing elements of a vector. From what I learned in the async course, v.at() throws an exception when the index is out of bounds, while v[] leads to undefined behavior in such cases.  The potential trade-off would be that v.at() maybe slower since we are calling a function? (Not sure if this is correct)   

**Answer**: Yep, your understanding is correct! v.at() will typically be slower than using v[ ], but it is safer and can help you catch potential bugs in your code. Which one you use is really up to you. You can still use v[ ] safely by ensuring that you don't access out-of-bounds elements (which you can check through thorough testing!)


# **Question 32**: Hi, In our last lecture, professor juett mentioned using a helper function for comparing floating point numbers instead of ==. I was wondering when I writing test cases, should I always use an equality function to compare floating point numbers? Specifically, for functions like max or min, it seems like their outputs can be compared exactly (since they should align perfectly). In such cases, would it be acceptable to use ==? Thanks.

**Answer**: Yes, for functions like min, max you can use == to check the output. For the error range there's really no correct answer, but I would recommend choosing a threshold smaller than 0.01. 


# **Question 33**: since i include assert sentences like assert(!v.empty()), does this mean i do not need to include them in my stats.cpp file? i tried to include it in both stats_test.cpp and stats.cpp file, and it makes Assertion failed, which logically i feel is right  but if it need to be include in both cpp file, then i might make something wrong, so i want to check here do we need to include the assert sentence in both files?  especially, as many functions require v is not empty    thx

**Answer**: You do not need to include assert() statements in stats.cpp. The autograder will not violate the requires clause for tests, however having assert statements in stats.cpp are valuable for debugging purposes. If a function is called incorrectly, the program will crash, allowing you to inspect the stack trace and find the issue.


# **Question 34**: In the project lecture notes, it says the following:   Simple test cases are for the “average” case. For instance, in testing a mode() function in Project 1, an example of a simple test case is one that tests a vector that contains exactly one mode (e.g. { 1, 2, 3, 2}).  Although it listed in the spec or the .h file, do we have to implement a mode function for project one? 

**Answer**: No, you do not have to implement a mode function. It is not listed in the specs or the stats.hpp starter file. As per the project 1 specs, you will only need to write implementations for the functions defined in the starters's .hpp files.


# **Question 35**: Do I need a test case for the filter function that includes a target that is not in the criteria vector? Or is that an unreasonable thing for a user to do?   I made this private because I don't know if it's considered an honor code violation to post test case ideas but I can make it public if you want!  

**Answer**: That's a wonderful test case idea! Note that in the REQUIRES clause of filter, there is no requirement that the target must exist in criteria vector. So, you do not need to check that the target already exists in the criteria vector.


# **Question 36**: Hi! I have been working on my stats.cpp file and passed everything up to stdev. I'm not quite sure why I have segmentation fault error popping up. I have attached my code for your reference. Thank you! 

**Answer**: Looking at the code, I cannot find a reason for a segfault to occur. 

Have you tried setting up the debugger?  If you're using vscode, you can use the debugger to see where the program is crashing. This may give insights into what is causing the segfault. 

If you cannot solve the problem, please come to office hours and we can help :)

Tutorial Link: https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_vscode.html


# **Question 37**: I'm not sure what these errors indicate. I can make stats_public_tests and run it which passes. Could someone please clarify this error.   Thank you.

**Answer**: Make sure your parameters for filter match what's written in stats.hpp. You made the vectors const references when they should just be regular copies.




# **Question 38**: everything in my output is the same as the cat.out.correct file, and only difference in the upper bound for 95% confidence interval i feel like this is probably caused by random seeds, but not sure because if it is because of the random seeds, why my lower bound is exactly the same as the correct file shows how can i find where the problem is? and if it is caused by random seeds, how can i find the seed set by autograder (which is mentioned somewhere in the eb that we need to use the same seed as the autograder to get the same result)    thx

**Answer 0**:  You do not need to worry about the seed as that is handled by bootstrap_resample(), which uses the same seed always. Make sure you are using this function for resampling.


**Answer 1**: We fixed it! I was bootstrapping 1001 times instead of 1000.


# **Question 39**: I am trying to test my standard deviation function with doubles but when I put assert with the expected outcome my code crashes, I am confused because when I just print out the the standard deviation function with the same vector it prints out the expected outcome.

**Answer**: Are you running assert with almost_equal()?




# **Question 40**: I'm new to UM this semester, and I've never used autograder before. At my previous institution's coding classes, used Codio and were able to see all the testcases that our code was run through. I was just a bit confused on how autograder works and how I can get more information on why my code is not passing.   For example in this image, I am confused on how to check why my code failed, and how to use this information to fix my program. I would just appreciate some guidance on how to approach feedback from autograder. Thank you.

**Answer**: Hi! While the autograder doesn't show you exactly what is inside every test, the error output you receive on autograder can often be helpful to get an idea of where you might be going wrong. For example, if you expand the tabs under some of your failing tests, you can see that some of your files are not compiling. This is why your test cases says they cannot find the "stats_public_tests.exe" file - since your code didn't compile, it was never created. 

To test specific functions in your code, making your own tests is definitely the best place to start! Try not to rely on the autograder too heavily for debugging. 


# **Question 41**: I'm not quite sure why I keep getting the wrong confidence interval. Here is my function for percentile and CI so far (I also attached mean_diff_sampling for your reference). I ran the make test and autograder and everything has passed up to this two-sample CI function. Please let me know where I should look more / edit! Thank you !! 

**Answer**: Hints for percentile: 

what is the intention of returning v[kindex] if the fractional component of the rank is 0? also, what should you be returning if the rank is 0, or if the rank is the same as the size of the vector?



(other functions look good to me)






# **Question 42**: I submitted my Project 1 and received a score of 9/9 on autograder. However, I noticed there are private test cases that are not currently visible to me. I assume these are test cases designed by the course instructors, which will only be accessible after the final grade for Project 1 is released (following the due date).  Since I completed this project a week before the due date, I was wondering if you could provide any tips to ensure my code successfully passes these private test cases as well.  I’ve already tested several edge cases using my stats_test file, but I’m concerned there may be additional edge cases that I haven’t considered.

**Answer**: Making sure that your code passes your own test cases, and that you've tested for edge cases is the best you can do. Unfortunately, there's not a way to guarantee a 100 on private test cases - but what you've done so far seems like it's put you in a really good spot 


# **Question 43**: I received an email saying there's a walkthrough session for Project 1 today that will be recorded and uploaded. I'm wondering when will it be posted on the lecture recording page?

**Answer**: You are most likely referring to the EECS 280 SI session that was hosted earlier today, you can probably find the link in your email if you look up EECS 280 SI, and the content is posted in a shared google drive folder, as I mentioned, it can either be found in your email, it was sent Thurs, Jan 16th, or I will try to attach a link to it here.

Also these sessions are being hosted through the Engineering Center for Academic Success (ECAS), and aren't directly related with the EECS 280 course, so that information (from what I know) won't be posted in any of the EECS 280 google drives or lecture recordings pages since it isn't part of the class and is supplemental instruction. All of the information for those sessions is in a separate ECAS EECS 280 google drive folder that was probably shared with you. The link to the general folder is here.


# **Question 44**: I'm having an error at the step where we are to put in the command make stats_public_test.exe in terminal. I get a linker command error saying this. All my code until this point is only starter code or the exact code for stats.cpp we are supposed to copy in for function stubs. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.  

**Answer**: Ensure that you have #include <vectors> and also that you are using namespace std;

#include <vectors>
using namespace std;


# **Question 45**: My cats.out file is the same as the cats.out.correct one except for the upper bound of the confidence interval. Mine computes 1.2, but the correct file has it as 1.2005. I use doubles for everything. How can I fix this?

**Answer 0**: It could be a variety of things. Maybe your math in percentile, or your confidence interval function implementation. If you're stuck for a while try office hours.


**Answer 1**: I had the same problem and I realized I just needed to use the modf function in the percentile function to break up the decimal part and the integer part to get that extra bit of accuracy. 




# **Question 46**: When I run the stats_public_tests.exe on Linux it is all smooth sailing until it reaches the percentile check. It gives me the failed message. When I run the same test on Visual Studio (operating on windows environment) it passes the test correctly and displays PASS!  I have run the debugger as well to compare the values being sent to almost_equal, and even compared them to a hand calculation of the same data. The result is that the two values pass the almost_equal assert check. I'm very confused. I will include a picture of my Percentile code.  

**Answer**: marking resolved




# **Question 47**: Hi. When I put 'make stats_public_tests.exe' into the terminal, it can't recompile related files, for example, stats.cpp; Every time I have to restart vscode to make it happen.   Thanks.

**Answer**: Thank you, already solved!
Just click command+s(macos) or set autosave in vscode(top bar--file--autosave).


# **Question 48**: So I know that if your Requires clause states something, then you are not required to handle cases which break the Requires clause. However, does that mean that we shouldn't include an assertion? For example, the mean function requires a non-empty vector, so can I assume the caller won't enter an empty vector or do I have to put "assert(!v.empty());"

**Answer**: You should put the assert since that is good programming practice. 




# **Question 49**: I was just wondering on what the process is to test out the test functions in the stats_test.cpp. Every time I run the project it just runs the main.cpp code and nothing else seemingly.     I am using Xcode as Fyi 

**Answer**: Take a look here: https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_xcode.html#compile-sources

You'll need to properly set your compile sources in order for the program to compile and run specific files using the visual debugger. For example, if I wanted to run stats_tests.cpp, I would need the following compile sources in Xcode:

stats_tests.cpp

stats.cpp

library.cpp

Notice how I only have included one file with a main() function (stats_tests.cpp in my compile sources. The rest of the files here just contain function definitions that I am using (so any .hpp files included at the top of stats_tests.cpp)


# **Question 50**: I am getting this error when trying to test out the functions in stats_tests.cpp   "Undefined symbol: percentile(std::__1::vector<double, std::__1::allocator>, double)"  It is not just for percentile but for all of the functions. Unfortunately there is not other message that comes with it so I am unsure how to diagnose correctly.

**Answer 0**: Okay I think I fixed it? It is not giving me that error anymore I just had to rename the int main() from the main.cpp file to something else like 'main2' so that it would run the right main for now.


**Answer 1**: see #97 -- the issue was because your compile sources likely included main.cpp as a source- which caused there to be a duplicate main function. Renaming the main() function in main.cpp works, but the linked ed post goes through a better way of fixing it.




# **Question 51**: I am using XCODE. I ran the stats_tests and publics tests, and it works. However, for two_sample, it shows that "Error opening cats.csv".  

**Answer 0**: Could you post a screenshot of the error?
**Answer 1**: Have you set a custom working directory?


# **Question 52**: My cats.out file is the same as the cats.out.correct one except for the upper bound of the confidence interval. Mine computes 1.2, but the correct file has it as 1.2005. I use doubles for everything. How can I fix this?  GSI Jung Min Lee tried helping me during office hours but we couldn't figure it out.  My code is updated on Autograder. Uniquename: amcpike  Thanks for your help!

**Answer**: Resolved!


# **Question 53**: Hi, my output for two_sample.cpp is giving me the correct output however my numbers aren't rounded. I'm unsure on what to do to fix this.

**Answer**: Rounding isn't likely the issue here, you should be getting the exact same values. A few things to check here.
1. Make sure you are bootstrapping 1000 times. Even 999 or 1001 times will produce slightly different values.
2. Make sure you are passing the iteration number to the bootstrap_resample() function. This ensures that the random numbers that are generated matches what we used to generate the output file. 


# **Question 54**: When trying to make my stats.cpp file, I keep getting hit with the same "make: Nothing to be done for `stats.cpp'.". I can't find a reason for that either.

**Answer**: You need to be doing 'make stats.exe' (or any other thing.exe) , not .cpp.


# **Question 55**: Is it possible for the 280 staff to update the due date of project 1 on canvas so all my assignments can be better organized on the dashboard page?

**Answer**: Answering this for completion: the rest of the project deadlines have also been updated in accordance to the eecs280.org website. 


# **Question 56**: Is the printing_descriptive_stats functions supposed to model that off of the cats.out.correct file? I feel like the 'Prints descriptive statistics' is pretty vague.

**Answer**: In the project spec under "Program Walkthrough" there is a more detailed description of the desired output for this function. 




# **Question 57**: Are there supposed to be any other includes in the main.cpp for example to be able to use the functions in two_sample or in stats.cpp?

**Answer**: For this project you don't need a main.cpp, instead you should have everything written within stats.cpp, two_sample.cpp and stats_tests.cpp as per the spec description.




# **Question 58**: Would it be fair to assume that data_A and data_B are always of the same size when working with the mean_diff_sampling_distribution function and in general in the two_sample file since in the header reads " * Data is read from filename, and filtered into two groups where the values  * in filter_column are equal to filter_val_a and filter_val_b."?    Thanks!

**Answer**: I would not necessarily assume that the entirety of dataset A and dataset B are always of the same size, but that is not a requirement to be able to implement the mean_diff_sampling_distribution function!




# **Question 59**: Hello, I submitted all three required cpp files to the autograder and received full points. Does this mean I have completed the project?  

**Answer**: Full points on the autograder is a good indicator of being done. Just make sure that you are happy with the amount of test cases you have written for stats.cpp as there are extra 'private test' points.


# **Question 60**: I got this strange error on autograder and I'm not quite sure where to start/ where to refer to. I can tell that something being out of bounds, but I'm not quite sure which of my functions even do that. I've checked the mean_diff_sampling_distribution (the only one that uses a loop that could be out of bounds)  /usr/include/c++/13/debug/vector:442: In function:     std::debug::vector<_Tp, _Allocator>::reference std::debug::vector<_Tp,      _Allocator>::operator[](size_type) [with _Tp = double; _Allocator =      std::allocator<double>; reference = double&; size_type = long unsigned      int]  Error: attempt to subscript container with out-of-bounds index 5, but  container only holds 5 elements.  Objects involved in the operation:     sequence "this" @ 0x7fbe1ec0cc40 {       type = std::debug::vector<double, std::allocator<double> >;     }

**Answer**: Take a look at your percentile function, specifically the case when the p parameter is equal to 1.


# **Question 61**: The make function does not work and creates an error message. I did cmd +s before this

**Answer**: The error messages can show you a lot of useful information that will help you figure out what’s wrong. For example, this one is telling you that you have a spot in your code where you declare a variable but never use it, and that you have a function with a non-void return type that doesn’t return a value. The number to the right of stats.cpp: tells you what line number of stats.cpp the errors are occurring at.


# **Question 62**: Hello, these are my tests (the comments below each function prototype) for each function (excluding test_sum_small_data_set()).  I have implemented them already and they passed when I submitted them to the autograder. Are there any functions I should consider adding more tests to? Also, do I need to create additional tests for test_sum_small_data_set() besides the one provided?  void test_count_small_data_set(); // test an empty vector   void test_mean_small_data_set(); // test vector with one value // test vector with only "0" elements // test vector with decimal mean   void test_median_small_data_set(); // test vector with even # of elements // test vector with odd number of elements // test vector with one value // test vector with all same values  void test_min_small_data_set(); // test vector with all same values & size 2 // test unsorted vector (not size 2) // test sorted vector (not size 2) //COMPLETED  void test_max_small_data_set(); // test vector with all same values & size 2 // test unsorted vector (not size 2) // test sorted vector (not size 2) //COMPLETED  void test_stdev_small_data_set(); // test vector with all same values  // test vector with decimals   void test_percentile_small_data_set(); // test vector with one element // test at 0th percentile // test at 100th percentile // test unsorted vector  // test sorted vector   void test_filter_small_data_set(); // test empty vector // test vector with one element // test with criteria value not in criteria vector  

**Answer**: For project 1, we have you create test cases to help catch bugs in your implementation of stats.cpp and two_sample.cpp. Feel free to make as many test cases as you would like! In future projects, you'll be making test cases to catch instructor bugs, so this will serve as a good practice.




# **Question 63**: The result for two_samples is correct when I tried to run that on a compiler. However, the autograder generates a different answer. I did use the function mentioned in the spec and I did pass in the current 0-indexed iteration number. Is there any reason that cause autograder to generate a different result?

**Answer 0**: Hey, can you show me what results you get for either format?


**Answer 1**:  Hello, I took a look at the code in your submission, things look good, and it also prints the expected output on my computer. It was unclear to me what the issue could be so I would take this into Office Hours. I'm really sorry I couldn't help you more. Good luck!


**Answer 2**: I went through your code and tried changing some things. Try changing line 51 in your two_sample.cpp as follows.

double meanA = mean(sample1);

double meanB = mean(sample2);

diff_sam.push_back(meanA - meanB);

This started generating the correct output for me in my terminal. I have to admit, I'm not sure why the behavior of C++ is different based on this change - logically they are identical. Let me know if this solves your issue. 
**Answer 3**: I went to the OH annd the TA told me to assign value to pair in another way. the autograder generates a correct result.

Thank you so much!


# **Question 64**: Is it necessary to test negative inputs in our stats functions? The datasets don't seem to contain negative numbers, but I don't see the requires clause restricting it.  

**Answer**: It's definitely a good idea! While there aren't any test cases you "need" to test, it's a good idea to test a wide range of values and any edge cases you can think of. 


# **Question 65**: Will the grey boxes turn blue if the auto-grader thinks the test cases are enough? To what extend will it turn blue?

**Answer**: I think the score for these is shown only after the project deadline. They are more thorough test cases for our implementations of the stats.cpp functions. If your code is fully correct and passes these tests, they should turn blue, but I believe we will only see the results after the project is due. Making sure your code is bug-free by writing as many of your own tests is the best way to pass as many of these private tests as you can.


# **Question 66**: libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::out_of_range: vector  When I execute the test for analysis, I got this error.  Does this mean I have problem on percentile function or confidence interval function?  Other descriptive stats are fine, but it terminates when the program starts to compute confidence interval.  

**Answer**: If your program crashed when you are beginning to compute the confidence interval then that is a good place to start looking. One thing that might help is setting up the address sanitizer: Setup Address Sanitizer | EECS 280 Tutorials


# **Question 67**: In my implementation for confidence_interval, I was unsure of how to use the width parameter and instead used 0.025 and 0.975 when calling the percentile function to calculate the upper and lower bounds. This seems to work fine since my output is the same as the cats.out.correct as well as full score on the autograder. Should I alter my implementation to make use of the width parameter or is it okay to continue with what I have? I want to maximize the amount of points I can receive for this project, so I am not sure if this is the right way to leave it.  

**Answer**: You should make use of the width parameter. Note that when testing your functions, we may decide to use different confidence intervals (i.e., 99%). Your code should be able to adapt to any width value. 


# **Question 68**: Hi,  I'm a bit confuse on the amount of tries that we can have in a project. I saw 0/3 but not sure if that'll be all the tries we get in a day or is it for the whole project ? - Thank you

**Answer**: You get three tries per day :)


# **Question 69**: Is that it? Or is there additional point graded by graders?

**Answer**: There are also private test cases that are run after the deadline. So, I highly recommend that you write your own test cases to ensure your program works as intended, especially focusing on testing edge cases.


# **Question 70**: Hello, I am having errors with two_sample public test (Undefined behavior check) in the autograder. I got a 9/9 on the autograder however this part of the autograder is yellow because nothing prints for the student output after the 75th percentile. I even checked my percentile function and the output for everything using the two_sample diff command as mentioned in the spec and nothing printed in the terminal showing how everything is printing as expected. I do not know what the error is in the autograder even though I am getting everything printed correctly in the terminal.  

**Answer**: The error message produced by the autograder is "attempt to subscript container with out-of-bounds index 5, but container only holds 5 elements." And you noticed that this happened after the 75th percentile was printed (and so right before the 100th percentile). So, what could be going wrong when calculating the 100th percentile?


# **Question 71**: When I press the run and debug button on vs code, it says <stats_tests.exe> does not exist, even though stats_tests.exe is a file that I made

**Answer**: you have to remove the "<" and ">" in the debug json file


# **Question 72**: My two_sample.cpp won't run my int main() function at all in auto grader. It shows no errors but it just says "reading error from food.. " and "reading error from weight..." and then stops. I don't know why it won't read my either two_sample_analysis() calls especially because its not throwing the error when argc doesn't equal 1 or 6.   

**Answer**: The error output says that it failed on an assert(false) in your filter function in stats.cpp. So, you need to first implement the filter function which is called on lines 88/89 in your two_sample.cpp.


# **Question 73**: I am not sure how to print the descriptive stats if an argument in the function isn't the filename. Do I print cats.csv directly?

**Answer**: The two_sample_analysis function, which we implemented for you, extracts the data from the file and calls your filter function that you wrote in stats.cpp. This create the data vector (data_A and data_B) which is the input for the print_descriptive_stats function. So you never have to deal with extracting the data yourself, you just calculate the stats of the vector that is input to the function.


# **Question 74**: Hello,  I'm trying to finish the code but the only missing part to my finished code is the mean_diff_sampling_distribution() and confidence_interval() section. If I've understood correctly, there should only be one variable in mean_diff_sampling_distribution() return vector? And then confidence_interval() takes that vector with one variable and uses the percentile funtion to find the 95% width?  This is what I've tried, but my results have been [0.04, 0.04]. Is there something I didn't understand in this step? Please let me know.  Thank you!

**Answer**: The [0.4, 0.4] confidence interval result usually comes from a bug in the mean diff function. Try to debug the mean diff function. What are the means you are pushing into the return vector? Are you using the bootstramp samples or the original datapoints passed in? Is the bootstramp sample function being called correctly? I hope this helps!


# **Question 75**: I'm writing test cases for my stats functions and I'm curious as to what I'm supposed to return. For example, if I call the mean function with an empty vector, I'm essentially doing 0/0 which is undefined. If the vector that is used in the function is empty, should I assert(false) and abort the code, or is there something I should be returning in the case of an empty vector?

**Answer**: You don't need to return a value if you're writing test cases using the unit testing framework. In the tests, you use the assertion statements provided by the framework to abort your tests upon failure. For a case like 0/0, you can check using a isnan() function outlined in the c++ library.

# **Question 76**: When trying to "make stats_public_tests.exe", I get this error:  "linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)"  Next line says:  "make: *** [stats_public_tests.exe] Error 1"  I googled some of this and it seems like I might need to do something to the json file? Put "stats.cpp" somewhere in the json file?  But I tried and it's still not working.

**Answer**: ok I figured it out 😅 I've been somehow doing this project kind of backwards and I was editing the .cpp files thinking that those have to be completely finished first with all the functions figured out. (I guess I thought it will be tested AFTER I fill in the missing code so everything with testing just comes after or smth). idk where I got that idea from. anyway i put them back to how they were at the start and then the public_tests compiled. 


# **Question 77**: Hi,   My project got a 9/9 in the autograder, but it says the two_sample public test is not passing. I tried looking at if any of the stats are not matching, but it seems the code just cuts off at line 14. I ran the test with cats in VS code and it passed(I think). I'm not sure what's wrong and/or how to fix it so any help would be much appreciated, thank you! I've attached screenshots in case I'm not explaining the situation well, I hope it helps!

**Answer**: I checked your autograder code and it says you are getting an out-of-bounds error. This is occurring when the code is trying to calculate the 100th percentile. Check your code to find where you might be accessing an out-of-bounds index. 


# **Question 78**: when I am using this function to test stdev(), the PASS! will be printed if result = 1.2 or 1.3. The value should be 1.29. So what's wrong here and how can I improve this code?

**Answer**: resolved


# **Question 79**: I don't understand why my percentile function isn't working. I haven't taken stats ever so it might just be me not understanding, but I followed the specs pretty word for word. 

**Answer**: A couple things to note here: Firstly, the equation given in the spec assumes the use of indexes that start at 1, while vectors are 0-indexed. (See the pitfall section of the percentile section in the spec for more info.) Secondly, although I don't think it should cause any issues, for conciseness sake I would take a look at the modf function which has its own section under percentile and incorporate that in your code.


# **Question 80**: Hi I got this notification "Assertion `almost_equal(percentile(data, 0.5), 2)' failed" Not sure why

**Answer**: This means that the assertion in whatever test you are running is failing. That is, the output of percentile(data, 0.5) is not 2 as the test expects. Without looking at your code, it's hard to debug this over Ed. I'd recommend you check your percentile function for errors or use the debugger to try and debug the issue on your own. Or, please come to office hours! If you're still having issues and can't make it to office hours, feel free to update this post with more information about what test you are failing.




# **Question 81**: Hello (posted privately since I'm not sure if sharing edge case ideas is ok)  Should I be considering instances of NAN as edge cases? If so, how should I handle them (value 0, remove the data point, ...?)  Thanks!

**Answer**: We don't teach you about NaN, so you don't have to consider it.


# **Question 82**: Every time I run my private tests, I can only see the printout for the given test (sum) but not the others I implemented.

**Answer**: Make sure you're calling your tests in your main() function in that file


# **Question 83**: Hi, I was running the public tests for stats.cpp and I keep getting a "Assertion failed: (almost_equal(mean(data), 2))". I know it has to do with my mean function, but I changed it and am still getting the error. 

**Answer**: There's not much we can tell you from just this error but here are some ways you can go about debugging. You are correct that there's something wrong with the mean function. The 'proper' way to figure out what's happening is to set up your debugger (Debugging Guide | EECS 280 Tutorials) and set a breakpoint on your mean function and step through to check what is happening. The quick and dirty way if you are having issues setting up your debugger could be to use cout statements to get some information on what is happening when your mean function is executing and go from there.


# **Question 84**: I have been trying to figure out why my confidence interval is incorrect. What could be wrong?

**Answer 0**: If you used abs() in mean_diff_sampling_distribution() that might have caused it, I thought at first that we had to use that to get the difference 
**Answer 1**: Hello! If the issue revolves around the [0.4, 0.4] confidence interval, take a close look at the function mean_diff_sampling_distribution(). In your implementation, how are you calculating the mean differences? Are you using the means of the dataset or the means of the sample provided by the bootstrap resample function? You will want to use the bootstrap sample to calculate the mean differences, so double check what arguments you are passing in.


# **Question 85**: I saw the other question posted about this, but I think I'm confused.   My VS Code is still detecting code that is commented out, I thought I was saving and recompiling but it's still happening.   I assume I'm saving correctly, that's just the keyboard shortcut or file>save.  How do I recompile? Do I say "make stats.exe", "make stats_public_tests.exe", or is "make" the wrong command altogether?   I'm confused because stats_public_tests is supposed to tell us if stats.cpp compiles. But if stats.cpp CAN'T compile, then that's because something is wrong with our code. So we shouldn't be saying "make stats.exe" until that's fixed.   So that means I have to recompile stats_public_tests.exe?  But when I try to do that, it won't do it and gives errors like "call to 'sum' is ambiguous".  I know there's a problem with my "sum" in stats.cpp but I'm not asking it to evaluate that, I'm just wanting it to compile stats_public_tests.exe, why does it care what my "sum" is doing? Shouldn't it only "care" after I run the .exe?   So I can only get it to compile a new stats_public_tests.exe if I completely erase all the edits I made to stats.cpp (and save it).  Is that normal?? Is that really how to recompile? I have to put stats.cpp back to square 1 every time?? and then paste in the stuff I was working on after the fact? That doesn't seem right but I don't know.   (I'm getting rid of my json file and making a new one every time too, I thought maybe that was causing problems. I don't know.)  Yes I'm a noob sorry. I hope this question makes sense.

**Answer**: I just like started everything completely over from the beginning/from scratch and compiled/ran the public test and it said "PASS!" 

But the problem is I have no idea what I'm doing :)

I was literally stuck on this all week and now it says "PASS!" with my original code that was returning errors. ?????!?1

lol

Still 100% confused on why recompiling on my original project didn't seem to be working like it should. (Really nothing seemed to be working like it's supposed to.) Maybe somebody can still give me an explanation about that?


# **Question 86**: Hello,  when checking the stats.hpp file, the RME definition includes a "requires" part. Does this mean we need to have an assert() that in our function?   I looked over similar doubts in Ed and most of the response said that REQUIRES means that we can assume the user won't input that case. However, question #96 said that we should include assert() statements for good practice.       Also, do we have to  use assert() to check anytime if the we are indexing a vector out of bounds?  Thank you    

**Answer**: You answered the first question pretty well yourself. Requires means that we assume something about the input we are given. It is still best practice to put an assert statement though just in case there is input being passed in from another function of yours that is invalid.



Writing asserts for making sure you are not indexing a vector out of bounds also sounds like a good idea, although in most cases if you are your code will error out anyways.


# **Question 87**: In two_sample.cpp, when running the public cat test, I am getting everything correct except my final confidence value is [-0.28, 1.201] rather than the correct values: [-0.28, 1.2005]. Clearly, this is a rounding issue, and I tried to search for solutions to clarify the number of decimals I want back but couldn't find any clear solutions. Let me know if there's any suggestions.

**Answer**: Figured it out. If anyone else has this rounding issue, check how many times you're looping in mean diff. For example, I had looped 999 times on accident rather than 1000 which provided the extra bit of accuracy.


# **Question 88**: Hello, do the three submissions a day in autograder count for individual days (I would get three today ad three tomorrow) or is it 3 submissions per 24-hour period (if I submit three by 3p.m. I can't submit again until 3 p.m. tomorrow)?  

**Answer**: They reset at midnight, so they count for individual days, not any 24 hour period.


# **Question 89**: I was wondering after what lecture would be a good time to start Project 2. I don't want to get ahead of myself and do things the hard way because I haven't learned it yet in lecture, but I also want to give myself enough time to complete it. Thanks!  

**Answer**: I was been told that we can start each project when we saw the spec for that project is being posted, which means we have cover everything for the project. 


# **Question 90**: Hello, when implementing print_descriptive_statistics, where are we printing the output? Is it just simply printing with cout statements? Or we print to a file (how would we do that)?  Thanks

**Answer**: You should be printing to cout. Then, if you want to print the output to a file instead, you can use bash’s output redirection, >. This is described in the spec, but if you use it in the form ./two_sample.exe > file.txt, or whatever other file name you want, it’ll redirect all of the console output of your code into that file.


# **Question 91**: Hello, for the function mean_diff_sampling_distribution, are we using a for loop to create a vector at the end that has 1000 mean differences, or does the 1000 mean that the bootstarp_resample function parameter "sample_num" is equal to 1000? I am having a bit of trouble understanding that "sample_num_ parameter.  

**Answer**: You're correct, for mean_diff_sampling_distribution,  you'll create a vector that has 1000 mean differences. The bootstrap_resample function gets called 1000s on data_A and data_B each, and the difference of means is added each time. 

Follow up if you're still confused!


# **Question 92**: Hello, my code and program worked well in my computer. I got the correct output and the correct confidence interval. However, when I submit to the autograder my result for confidence interval appears different. Is there a reason for this?  I believe it's because I'm not doing the following part correctly: "Use only the provided bootstrap_resample() function declared in library.hpp to perform resampling with replacement and ensure you pass in the current 0-indexed iteration number - this is necessary to ensure consistent pseudorandom number generation for autograding purpose". What does this mean?     Thank you

**Answer**: This means that you need to use the bootstrap_resample() function in two_sample.cpp. bootstrap_resample() takes in two inputs - the vector you are trying to resample from, and an integer that is used to seed a random number generator. Seeds allow you to "lock" the random number generator so that it's replicable across different machines. If you use the same seed for two random number generators, they will both output the same "random" numbers. 

However, if you are getting the same results on your local machine, I don't think the pseudorandom number generation would be the problem.  




# **Question 93**: Hi, I was wondering if I can add more library eg: cmath into two_sample.cpp file ? 

**Answer**: There shouldn't be any additional libraries you require for two_sample.cpp. Remember that we want you to take advantage of the functions you already defined in stats.cpp. Any mathematical calculations will involve just calling one of those functions. If you still need to use a new library, can you provide more details in a private comment or post?


# **Question 94**: Can someone explain what the confidence interval is/what steps I'm supposed to take? I don't understand the formula or what the spec is trying to say. Thanks!

**Answer**: I had the same question, and this is how I thought of it, although im not 100% this is how its supposed to be interpreted.

Essentially you're trying to find the upper bound and lower bound percentiles given a width. The width is like the area between the upper and lower bound. For example, in the RME example of 0.8 width and the interval was 90th and 10th percentile| .9 - .1 = .8 (which is the width). So, you need to find a way to get those lower and upper bounds given any width between 1 and 0. This one is pretty much a bunch of math and logic. I don't believe you actually have to look up the confidence interval formula, I did that and just got more confused. This video from the stats project page might help.

Hope that helps a little!


# **Question 95**:   Hello EECSS 280 staff!  When I am performing my tests, I received an error as follows:  hadis22@DESKTOP-PNMSGN0:~/eecs280/stats$ make test g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++17 -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-comment stats_public_tests.cpp stats.cpp -o stats_public_tests.exe g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++17 -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-comment stats_tests.cpp stats.cpp -o stats_tests.exe g++ -Wall -Werror -pedantic -g --std=c++17 -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-comment two_sample.cpp stats.cpp library.cpp -o two_sample.exe ./stats_public_tests.exe PASS! ./stats_tests.exe test_sum_small_data_set PASS! ./two_sample.exe cats.csv food 1 2 weight > cats.out diff cats.out cats.out.correct 32c32 <   95% [-0.28, 1.2] --- >   95% [-0.28, 1.2005] make: *** [Makefile:9: test] Error 1    I believe I have tracked down the source of the problem to my percentile() function, as there is nothing else that could possibly create a rounding error from 1.2005 to 1.2. However, I cannot figure out what is going wrong no matter how hard I try.    Since this is going out to staff only, I think I can submit my code here for one of you all to take a look. If this violates honor code, please delete this thread immediately and inform me at hadisow@umich.edu so that I know to keep code from everyone including staff.  Furthermore, on my autograder submission, there's 9 points instead of the 21 on canvas, and there's all those greyed out tests. I am wondering if I am missing out on a bunch of potential points.  Thank you for your time and review!

**Answer**: Hi Hadi, I took a look at your code. It looks like you are setting a fixed size for your vector mdsd_v in mean_diff_sampling_distribution. Note that this vector is just going to be holding the 1000 mean values from your calculations. Hope this helps!


# **Question 96**: I am trying to do the floating-point comparison needed for stdev test cases. However, the comparisons tutorial seems to tell us to compare to "epsilon" but when I used epsilon in my code, it is being flagged as undefined. Any advice on how to resolve this would be super helpful. Thank you!

**Answer**: You are likely getting this error because you never defined epsilon. Epsilon is an actual value that you need to set - this is the threshold for how much difference you allow between the output of your function and the expected output when comparing floating-point numbers as precision issues may mean that your values can be slightly different for lower decimal places even if your function is logically correct. 




# **Question 97**: I'm checking my cats.out with the cat.out.correct and I know if it's correct you're not supposed to get an output but I am, and it looks the same? Any help is appreciated

**Answer**: Looks like it's a spacing issue with the percentiles. They should be aligned by digit place. 0 should be in the same space as the last zero in 100.


# **Question 98**: I understand using assert(!v.empty()) is good practice to ensure the require clause of functions RME's are never violated. However, is this required to pass the private tests / autograder for our projects?   

**Answer**: Asserting to make sure you are not violating the RME is not required to pass any of the tests on the autograder.


# **Question 99**: I don't understand why my median function is giving the wrong output in autograder for two_sample test. I've run a bunch of test on my own and they are giving the correct output. It's almost like in autograder its running my mean function instead of my median.   

**Answer**: So it turns out you are calling the mean function instead of the median in your print_descriptive_stats function. 




# **Question 100**: Am I allowed to use camelCase for variable and snake_case for function names?  

**Answer**: Completely up to you. We only do automated style checks (from P2 onwards) and the results of them are visible to you on the autograder. This isn't something that's checked.


# **Question 101**: How bad is it if only was able to get 8/9 on public tests. How difficult overall is going to be to recover from this. How much % is it?

**Answer**: Project 1 is worth just 4% of your total class grade. This is very recoverable - don't stress too much. One of the biggest pieces of advice the instructional team can give is to start the projects very early. Project 2 is an order of magnitude larger that Project 1, so I would suggest this. Note that once the private test cases are released, your grade will be out of 24, not 9.




# **Question 102**: I saw on the calendar that there's a Project 2 overview session on 1/28 at 8 pm, but there's no link to more info attached to it. Is this session still happening, and if so, how can we attend?

**Answer**: Yes, the session is still happening! More info will be out soon...


# **Question 103**: Will the recording for the Project 2 overview session be posted?

**Answer**: Yup, it'll be posted on Ed


# **Question 104**: If we choose to have a partner for this project, what would be a way to share code? Is there a way to both work on the code at the same time or just doing it individually and emailing the code to each other or something? 

**Answer 0**: VSCode has a thing called live share that maybe you could use: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/use/share-project-join-session-visual-studio-code
**Answer 1**: Version control using Github is a great way to do this (and a good skill to learn). You can walk through the tutorial here: https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_git.html.

The spec sheet for Project 2 also recommends using version control. Even if you are not working with a partner, it's good practice to have a github repository so you can backup your work in case something happens to your local copy. 


# **Question 105**: When looking at the mutation tests, there is an option to reveal a hint for a particular bug. Do the amount of hints reset per project and are there any deductions if we do use the hints?  

**Answer 0**: hints will not reduce your score! and i don't know if all of the projects will have hints, but the amount of hints you use on one project will not affect the number of hints you get on another project.


**Answer 1**: There are no deductions with using hints and they reset per project


# **Question 106**: Is it ok to add "Using namespace std" at the top of the document so we don't have to do the "std::" every time?  Thank!

**Answer**: yes! this is pretty much always okay as long as it's a cpp file and we are not explicitly told otherwise i believe ^^


# **Question 107**: After reading the Effects of this function I was wondering whether it means to output the numerical column of the lowest value, where the first column would be 1, or whether it's supposed to output the index of the column with the lowest value.  

**Answer**: The output should be the index of the column with the lowest value. The wording in the RME that tells us this is that the region you are looking at is exclusive of column_end which has a max of matrix_width, aka for a row of length 5, the largest number you could return is 4 and vice versa with column_start being inclusive and it's minimum value being 0.


# **Question 108**: In the project specs, it states: "In particular, only the Matrix_init and Matrix_at functions should access the data member directly. All other functions should access elements by calling Matrix_at() as a helper. functions instead."  Are we explicitly forbidden from accessing the data member of a matrix in other matrix.cpp functions? There are a few implementations where accessing the data member directly seems cleaner to me, particularly in the Matrix_fill() function.   Thanks!

**Answer**: You are not explicitly forbidden from using the data member variable in other parts of the Matrix file but we would highly recommend using the matrix_at function when you can.




# **Question 109**: I am wondering whether we need to check about the REQUIRES in our code  For example, // REQUIRES: mat points to a Matrix                        //           0 < width && 0 < height  Does that mean we need to add lines to check whether width or height is greater than 0, or it is just requirement for test or users?  Thank you!

**Answer**: It isn't required. You can safely assume that we won't break the requires clause in public/private tests. However, we still highly recommend that you add assert statements that check the REQUIRES clause. This will make debugging much much easier for you. 




# **Question 110**: So I setup github and I have a private repository for the project, when I access it I can go to starter-files and it basically has all my files with the code inside  ...now what? is that? to hold and update code for me to have as a separate function or? I am not sure what this is for since Ive never used anything like it.

**Answer**: GitHub is especially useful if you're working with a partner, because it allows you and your partner to both work independently on your own local (stored on your computer) project files, then safely merge both of your changes together.

But even if you're working on your own, using git is still good practice and will allow you to restore previous versions of your code should anything happen to it!

I'm not sure what you mean by "separate function", but if you mean will GitHub automatically upload your code for you-- no, you'll have to push to the repository manually. EECS 280 has a tutorial for how to use it if you need it! --> https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/setup_git.html#eecs-280-tutorials


# **Question 111**: I am trying to commit my matrix after making changes and changing the name, but it's just stuck loading, not actually doing anything. Is this a setup problem, or do I just need to wait a really long time?

**Answer**: It should not take longer than a few seconds. Can you please show me what you see?


# **Question 112**: Can I just look up the conversion or Do I need to come up with the math myself? is there a hint for this or?

**Answer**: Googling is a skill so feel free to look things up in this class. Heres a hint for you though:

We are told the element is in a certain row. How do we figure out how many elements are in the rows before that row.

After we know that, what do we do with the column to get the specific index.


# **Question 113**: Private question because of code sharing  So I implemented Matrix_fill below in the "intended" (longer way):   But before reading the spec and realizing I had to access it using Matrix Fill, I did it like: (*mat).data = vector<int>(((*mat).width * (*mat).height) , value); so basically just taking the vector and replacing it with an equal size intended vector  The second operation seems easier, am I strictly not allowed to use it?

**Answer**: You should keep your current solution. Refrain from directly accessing the data variable when you can.


# **Question 114**: I assume this is not the case for Matrix_height and Matrix_width correct? we can access directly for those?  

**Answer**: the Matrix struct has 3 member variables, and of the 3, data is not what you need for Matrix_height or Matrix_width! but yes, you may directly access the variables you need here since these are the functions that will serve as the "getters" for height and width.


# **Question 115**: 1. Does style check mean efficiency of code? for example ++i would receive more points than i = i+1? If I create a function in a certain longer way, but theres a shorter way to create it, will I be marked down? what exactly does "style check" check for?  2. Does style check work only for implementation files only or will we be style checked on tests aswel (if a test is redundant/ if a test isnt doing anything)...  

**Answer**: 1. The style checks do not check for small efficiencies in code like your first example. There are checks for things like length of functions, length of single lines, deep nesting, and chunks of code being re-used multiple times. All these will show up at the bottom of any autograder submission and should be pretty easy to fix if you miss some points. Additionally, for P2 there is a maximum time your project can take to run (i think 5 secs), but you should only be hitting that if there is some major inefficiency somewhere. 



2. not 100% sure but I would assume the style checks are for test files as well. Again, if you do miss points it should be pretty easy to fix the issue.


# **Question 116**: since input of data is in integers, should I try to manipulate the CPP and HPP file of matrix to get it to accepts doubles values (small decimal points), and test for ALMOST_EQUAL, or is that unnecessary?

**Answer**: that is unnecessary


# **Question 117**: Hello, I am struggling with setting up Version Control for project 2. I successfully connected to GitHub with an SSH key. However, my partner created the local repository and remote repository. I can see the project on my GitHub account, but I'm just confused about which steps of the tutorial I should follow next if that makes sense?  

**Answer**: If you can see the project in your GitHub, you should be able to open up VS Code (or the IDE of your choice). If you are using VS Code, there should be an option to "Clone Git Repository" which should let you select the repository that you just made for Project 2. 


# **Question 118**: Title

**Answer**: purely based on the lecture titles I think you should be good with everything for the project after lecture 6 maybe 7.


# **Question 119**: Hi!  I'm working on the matrix _init() function, which is supposed to have integers passed in. When I tested it, however, you can pass doubles in, and they convert to integers. Is this ok, or should I assert the function that the value passed in must be an int? If so, how would I assert that?  Thanks!

**Answer**: No you do not need to assert for that. 


# **Question 120**: I am getting the error of segmentation fault. I can't really find out the reason by debugging. What might be the reason for that. One wired thing is that it is error in the matrix_test.exe. By the way why is the test case passing the width as the row, shouldn't height match to row?

**Answer**: The segmentation fault happens when you run Matrix_tests.exe, but the bug in your code causing this segmentation fault is going to be in Matrix.cpp within one of the functions called by test_fill_basic. I would suggest setting break points so that you can walk through your code with the debugger and see when the segmentation fault happens. 



Matrix_at function takes in first row, then column while the Matrix_init function takes in width and then height. Line 18 passes in 3 and then 5 which matches the width and the height initialized above. Then line 23 passes row and then column.


# **Question 121**: How exactly does one Assert these requires clauses?  Do they fall under the "not everything can be checked" category?

**Answer**: Yep that’s correct! Some things like this can’t be checked with an assert() statement.


# **Question 122**: Hello, both of these functions are not passing public tests in the autograder but I cannot identify where the errors are.  In the autograder, the ASSERT_EQUAL statements are failing. 

**Answer**: your issue is in the matrix_at function, which both these tests use. 

do you see anything odd about the pointer you return here? think back to scope from earlier lectures.


# **Question 123**: When testing, is it ok if I use functions inside tests even if the order is off  for example, lets say I have  func 1  Func 2  Now in my test file, to test func 1, I call Func 2 (it just so happens theyre related)  is that ok? or would I have to access member types directly instead? (assuming thats what Func 2 does)

**Answer**: you can use functions to help you test other functions. do not access member types directly in your test files.


# **Question 124**: So Im confused on testing, Lets say I do Image.cpp for example, and hypothetically I write functions that are perfect (operationally, no issues)  Then i test each of these functions once to make sure they compile and work as intended...  is that sufficient, because I have it so that any "wrong" implementation is immediately striken off by the implementation of ASSERT (for example, if I give dimensions of zero, which the spec tell me to "assert" against)  In these cases, what would an "edge case" even be? If we cant assume much larger values (small scope theory), and we cant test with wrong implementation, whats there to check other than the functionality?  

**Answer**: A couple things to note here:

#1: the purpose of the test files is to help you decide whether your functions are written correctly. assuming off the bad that your functions are working as intended is the wrong mindset.

#2: 'wrong implementations' is not the same as passing in incorrect parameters so asserting things in the RME would not catch bugs (but still is a good habit)

#3: edge cases in this project can a lot of times really just be edge cases aka borders or corners of an image. 


# **Question 125**: The RME for Matrix.cpp says that I should be returning a pointer to a given element, but returning a pointer in a function means that the variable will go out of scope meaning the pointer address is no longer viable. I am confused on how we can return a pointer for this then

**Answer**: Within Matrix.cpp, I am assuming that you are referring to the Matrix_at() functions that return pointers, which are valid return types because the pointers should be pointing to an address of one of the elements of data, a member of the Matrix struct. Therefore, it is not going out of scope the way that a variable declared within that function would.




# **Question 126**: is it possible  image/matrix with a width of 1 would be passed in? should we guard against that or is it not checked for this kind of algorithm?   I assume its not a valid input because how would even carve an image with width 1?  Should I at least assert it must not be one?

**Answer**: This is an interesting edge case! Unless something is specifically stated in the requires clause, I would not assume anything!


# **Question 127**: So my testing passed for everything, the correct section indicates test that passed instantly but the section highlighted  "?" took a solid 15 seconds each before running, is that normal? Or have I made a mistake somewhere?

**Answer**: from the spec, "If your program takes about 30 seconds for large images, that’s ok. There’s a lot of computation involved."

you're all good!


# **Question 128**: I keep recieving this issue when trying to use perf, I have tried installing packages and debugging but it refuses, is there any suggestion?

**Answer**: On WSL, perf has issues running (I've attempted and have had issues myself). I would suggest using your CAEN account to access an environment that lets perf work. :) I hope this helps.




# **Question 129**: In Matrix.hpp, the Matrix struct is described as a 2D matrix of integers, yet the vector in its definition is a 1D vector. How are we supposed to code the Matrix function implementations as if the vector is 2D?

**Answer**: Once you write the matrix_at function, which works with the matrix as a 1d array, you should be able to use the matrix_at function to treat the matrix as a 2D.


# **Question 130**: So I cannot see my commit on github in the p2-image-processing code section. I even linked my umich email in the github account because the email is my personal one so I did that so the commit would show up but I still cannot see it. However, when I do git log on the terminal I am able to see my original commit with the umich email address but I just cannot see it in the project page.

**Answer**: After you committed, did you run git push?


# **Question 131**: I noticed in the "requires" clause of the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row and Matrix_min_value_in_row, the column_end's value is inclusive of the Matrix_width(mat).  I am confused because the "width" of the Matrix is not an index. But column_end is an index (since column_start includes 0 as the lowest bound), therefore prone to index out of bounds.   Is this a typo or something we have to consider as a conditional statement?   // REQUIRES: mat points to a valid Matrix //           0 <= row && row < Matrix_height(mat) //           0 <= column_start && column_end <= Matrix_width(mat) //           column_start < column_end

**Answer 0**: From my understanding, column_start and column_ end are not indexes. Rather, they are the specific columns in each row. Think of it in terms of the interface.


**Answer 1**: the effects clause states that the 'region' you are looking at is exclusive of column end.


# **Question 132**: Does using hints on the Matrix_tests.cpp affect the amount of hints you can use on Image_tests.cpp? Like is there a total number of hints you are allowed per project or is it 3 for Matrix_tests and 2 for Image_tests regardless?

**Answer**: As far as I remember the only restriction on hints is how many you can use per autograder submission. Using them on one file vs the other should not impact you later on in the project.




# **Question 133**: Hi! Are we allowed to include other libraries; for example, use #include <algorithm> so reverse() can be used inside find_minimal_vertical_seam?  

**Answer**: You should be able to implement that function without needing to use reverse.


# **Question 134**: Hi, I was working on the initialization of an image from a PPM file and I was confused about methods to go about this. In particular, I was confused about how to account for whitespace between rgb values. The project specs say that using C++ style I/O will be fine, but I had a couple of questions for this.  Does the extraction operator >> read until the next whitespace and then leave it? Meaning I have to using a "dummy" char variable before moving to the next integer.  If I use a string to read in whitespace to, will the input stop at one whitespace character or until the next non-whitespace character?  Ultimately, I am just very confused on how C++ input works when it comes to whitespace.

**Answer**: If you use the >> operator it will skip over all whitespace.


# **Question 135**: Hi, I was wondering if I could get some hints as to what I'm messing up here. I'm passing the remove_vertical_seam tests for all 3 images, but only passing seam_carve for the dog.  Here is my code for seam_carve_width, seam_carve_height, and seam_carve:  void seam_carve_width(Image *img, int newWidth) {   for (int i = 0; i < Image_width(img) - newWidth; i++) {     Matrix energyMatrix;     compute_energy_matrix(img, &energyMatrix);      Matrix costMatrix;     compute_vertical_cost_matrix(&energyMatrix, &costMatrix);      vector<int> seam = find_minimal_vertical_seam(&costMatrix);      remove_vertical_seam(img, seam);   } }  void seam_carve_height(Image *img, int newHeight) {   rotate_left(img);   seam_carve_width(img, newHeight);   rotate_right(img); }  void seam_carve(Image *img, int newWidth, int newHeight) {   seam_carve_width(img, newWidth);   seam_carve_height(img, newHeight); }  

**Answer**: I figured it out, it's because the for loop condition is going to change every time (since I remove a seam every time Image_width(img) is different each iteration)


# **Question 136**: For Matrix and Image personal test cases, should we be deleting the matrices created during the test at the end of the test case (like, a line of code that says delete matrixName or something) for memory purposes?

**Answer 0**: I believe 280 (as opposed to ULCS courses) does not account for memory usage in project rubrics so it should not matter.


**Answer 1**: Remember that we only have to use delete when we explicitly allocate memory with new. So as long as you are not dynamically allocating matrices, you do not need to handle deleting matrices. Once the function ends, they will go out of scope and be deleted automatically. 


# **Question 137**: Are we allowed to create our own helper functions that weren't already given to us in the starter code? I want to make a Matrix_min function to use in places throughout Matrix.cpp but wasn't sure if we are allowed to add more helper functions

**Answer 0**: I don't Believe we are allowed to modify HPP files so if you modify your CPP file im pretty sure you cant cross-call that function with any other module.

If this is just used for Matrix.cpp any effort into implementing a new function would probably be harder than just directly using the logic in each separate function since you will only call it at a maximum twice and only in one file.

regardless, I assume if you call a CPP function thats in HPP, and that function calls a function not found in HPP, when you use the original function in any other file it will fail.




**Answer 1**: From the spec, "Put any extra helper functions in the .cpp files and declare them static." Do not "Modify .hpp files." 


# **Question 138**: for my processing function find_minimal_vertical_seam I included an "Algorithm" library to reverse the vector.  I know we don't have to, I just found this way to be simpler, is that acceptable?  

**Answer**: It is okay to add helper functions in your code! However, be careful with submitting separate .cpp files onto the autograder, as it automatically deletes unrecognized files. For project 2, the autograder only recognizes: 

 Image.cpp

 Image_tests.cpp

 Matrix.cpp

 Matrix_tests.cpp

 processing.cpp

 resize.cpp

I hope this helps!


# **Question 139**: I'm trying to debug both my Image_test.exe and Image_public_test.exe, but keep getting this strange error. I did restart my computer and quit VS Code, but am still getting this error. Both .exe files do exist and say that they are up-to-date. I haven't changed anything to them.     

**Answer**: You might want to check that the directory is set correctly in your launch.json file. If not, then it might be best for you to come to office hours as it might be hard to resolve over Ed. 




# **Question 140**: Hi!  I am using a few assertions to ensure that I am reading in PPM input correctly and want to know how to handle the input, specifically the image intensity. Should I make sure that the image intensity is always 255 or not hardcode it and rather say that all the pixels should have at most that image intensity?   For example, if someone puts in 250, should that throw an error? Or, should we say that all of the pixels should then have values at most 250?  Hope that makes sense, thanks!

**Answer**: The maximum intensity is 255.
0 <= Intensity <= 255.


# **Question 141**: Hello! The rules for the Compute_energy_matrix state that it should do the following:  Initialize the energy Matrix with the same size as the Image and fill it with zeros.  Compute the energy for each non-border pixel, using the formula above.  Find the maximum energy so far, and use it to fill in the border pixels.  Does "so far" imply that we should check for the max pixel energy EVERY TIME and update it as we go? If so, why does the function do this? It seems very slow to find the max and refill the borders each time.

**Answer**: I believe that would not make sense operationally.

"so far" means at the point where you have calculated all non-border pixels energies, you take the maximum one (ex say 1400), and assign that as the value for each border pixel.


# **Question 142**: Example:  I submit Image.cpp and Image_tests.cpp  my test are written exactly in order of CPP   Auto grader says "Image fill" (last function in both files) failed to catch a bug.  is this to say all previous ones did not? Or?

**Answer**: Our bugs are in a determined order. So, when you get a hint the Autograder give you hint for the "next" bug you are failing to catch. If you're getting a hint for a bug relating to Image fill, it means that your tests haven't caught that bug.

I'm not sure if that entirely answers your question, so let me know if you have any others! :)


# **Question 143**: Is it okay to state using namespace std; at the top of our files of the project?

**Answer**: Yup, it's actually encouraged!


# **Question 144**: Hello,   So i wanted to ask about the Test_matrix function, in the spec it tells us to ostream and gives us an example of how to test  I just copied that example and then added different values for different cases, submitted to the auto grader.  Will that be an issue? I was told we were allowed to use any code provided on the spec sheet and this literally says to use it, but I am afraid the direct copy pastes will be a problem.  

**Answer**: Any code you see in the spec, lecture, lab, or anything we provide to you is free game.


# **Question 145**: Matrix_fill(Matrix* mat, int value),  does this function mean to set every element in the mat to be the same value?  thx

**Answer**: Yes


# **Question 146**: Hi,  For the function Matrix_fill_border, I was wondering how I should check that the squares of the matrix are correct after function call. I am planning on using loops to go through the border cells, but I was wondering if there is a better way to do this that I am not seeing.

**Answer**: Using loops is fine


# **Question 147**: Hello! For resize.cpp, users can choose whether or not to enter a height. Initially I was going to do an if statement for if they enter 4 arguments or 5, but I think the code is too long that way (since I basically have two copies of almost the same code). I'm assuming there will be out of bounds errors if I totally ignore this though. Is there a better solution?

**Answer**: Hello! According to the specs, if there is no height inputted into the command line, you set the height to be equal to the image's original height. You can have one copy of the code that modifies the resize height based on the arguments given. 


# **Question 148**: Should the const and regular Matrix_at functions have the same code even though one returns a constant integer pointer?

**Answer**: from the spec, "There are two versions of the Matrix_at function to support element access for both const and non-const matrices. The constness of the pointer returned corresponds to the Matrix passed in. The implementations for these will be identical."


# **Question 149**: In autograder, if a file passes all private tests, can we assume that it works as it should and there is nothing more to do for it? My image.cpp passed all autograder private tests, however, it is failing some of my test cases that I made, and I'm trying to see if the autograder doesn't catch every bug or if my test case itself is incorrect.

**Answer**: There are some more private tests whose grades are not shown. These tests are "greyed" out on the autograder. I highly suggest making sure your code passes your private tests, as your code may fail / bug out on these private tests :)


# **Question 150**: Is it necessary to set up version control if you are working alone on project 2?

**Answer**: It's not a necessity but as others have mentioned, it's good practice. Even when you are working alone, using version control will allow you to safely store your files and recover your old files if necessary. 


# **Question 151**: I am trying to do this function, and my thought process is fill when column is 0& width -1 or when row is 0 & height -1. But I do not really know how to go about this. Please help  

**Answer**: Here's a hint for you:

You will probably have two for loops, one to fill the top and bottom rows, and another to fill the left and right columns. Feel free to follow up if you have any questions.


# **Question 152**: Is it ok to include <algorithm> library in cpp file to be able to use the  std:: max_element in a vector?  

**Answer**: You should be able to do without the algorithm library.


# **Question 153**: For compute_energy_matrix, do we have to make an energy matrix for each color in an image? Like will this function have to create an energy matrix for red, green, and blue when called.

**Answer**: marking as resolved.


# **Question 154**: My autograder is saying, "3 more hint(s) remain for "Matrix Bug 1." Does this mean I have 3 hints per submission, or do I have a total of 3 hints for the entire project? So, if I were to use 3 hints right now, does that mean when I submit to autograder again, they will all be used up?

**Answer**: you should have 3 hints per autograder submission


# **Question 155**: When testing Matrix.cpp, should we have test cases testing the requires clause (like checking if width < 0)?   If so, how would we get around the project aborting due to the assert clause included in the Matrix.cpp implementation of the function?

**Answer**: No, you do not need to test things that are specified as invalid by the Requires clause. These tests will hit your assertions and terminate your program


# **Question 156**: For Matrix testing , the specs for the project state : Heed the Small Scope Hypothesis. There is no need for large Matrix structs. (Other than an as edge case for max size.)   What edge case is being referred to here? I do not see ant MAX_SIZE define in .hpp file.  Should we be testing  for pre defined INT_MAX ?  My autograder submission says: Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row() - Your tests fail to catch a bug in this function. I am trying to figure out the tests that are missing in my code.  

**Answer**: Hello, this is from an old version of a project, so no, you don't need to define a test for assessing a max size edge case. Thanks for pointing this out!


# **Question 157**: If there is a Matrix which is only border pixels (for ex. 2 by 2). what should it's energy be. Would all Matrix values be 0?  

**Answer**: The steps from the spec should be able to answer your question:

1. Initialize the energy Matrix with the same size as the Image and fill it with zeros.

2. Compute the energy for each non-border pixel, using the formula above.

3. Find the maximum energy so far, and use it to fill in the border pixels.

Let me know if you're still unsure.


# **Question 158**: Do we need to write a separate test for every function in Matrix.cpp, or can we just write tests for some matrices and test each function within that test?

**Answer**: You could do either of those, but I recommend that you write at least one separate test for every function. This is better testing practice because it helps you isolate problems in your code to a certain function. It also wouldn't hurt to do a thorough test for some matrices, applying each function, but I'd focus primarily on the separate tests.




# **Question 159**: As given in the spec, resize.cpp expects us to run the program with several arguments in order to function properly. However, I can't figure out how to use those arguments when trying to debug that program through the VSCode built-in debugger. In the configuration file for said debugger, there is a line for "args", but it doesn't seem to actually work - the debugger throws a fit when I try to actually put any arguments in there.  Does anyone have an idea for properly testing resize.cpp through the debugger, and running it with arguments?  

**Answer**: Ensure that you are putting the args in the launch.json properly: Setup VSCode | EECS 280 Tutorials
If you are, what is the debugger doing when you try to run it?


# **Question 160**: I am getting a fail on cost for crabster and horses tests but not dogs when running the processing public tests. So i put an assert before sending to matrix_at() to make sure im not sending any out of bounds columns since i was getting this error Assertion failed: (0 <= column && column < Matrix_width(mat)), function Matrix_at, file Matrix.cpp, line 70. and the assertion i put does fail but when stepping through the debugger using a break point no column is getting sent out of bounds? is that possible or am i missing something?

**Answer 0**: Since the crabster image is so big, your code is going to be calling Matrix_at() in a lot of different places. If you just put a breakpoint in Matrix_at(), it'll be very hard to find the case where you're calling it with an invalid width and height. Instead, try getting rid of all breakpoints and running the debugger. It should break when you reach the failed assert statement in Matrix_at() and you'll be able to see the state of your program at that point. Hope that helps!
**Answer 1**: A tip I have is that the dog image is 5x5, while the other matrixes do not have the equal width and height. You may not be stepping out of bounds, but it may be the case your processing functions are computing/loop incorrectly. Double check the predicates in your loops within your processing functions. 




# **Question 161**: Hello! I am working on the seam_carve_width function and I noticed in the RME there is a note stating "You can use .data() on a vector to get the underlying array", does this mean we should be using .data() on a vector at some point in the function? I know for implementation we will need to initialize a vector and use it, but I am unsure of how or where I should use .data() on that vector?  Thank you!

**Answer**: Here is some more info on how .data() member function works, essentially it returns a pointer to the first element in the vector. I agree that the note in the RME is peculiar, especially because remove_vertical_seam() accepts a reference to a vector. It is okay if you find yourself not needing to use .data() .




# **Question 162**: Why aren't we able to point to the data to make the functions as we can in Matrix? ex: matrix->data, but can't do img->data  

**Answer**: If you're talking about functions like Image_init(), Image doesn't actually have a member called data. Instead, Image has 3 matrices: red, green, and blue.

When we initialize an image, or alter its data, we do so by altering these matrices. Remember to use the Matrix interface functions you wrote before to do this, you should never have to access a Matrix's data member directly from outside of Matrix.cpp. Does that help?


# **Question 163**: Hello! For the compute_energy_matrix function, the only requirement is that img points to a valid Image.  However, doesn't this mean that the height or width of the image can be 1 or 2, making everything a boarder pixel?  Wouldn't this make it impossible to calculate the energy since there would be no east or west pixels or north or south pixels? What should happen then?  

**Answer**: If the only requirement that img points to a valid image, then I would assume that all possible sizes of a matrix need to be able to be handled by your implementation! If an image has a width or height of 1 or 2, your implementation should handle it accordingly, as it is still possible to calculate the energy.




# **Question 164**: I'm working on Image.cpp and when I ran it through the public tests it says the assert equal fails and shows where it is supposed to not match, but I can't see the issue. I've tried adding spaces and newlines, and I can't find the issue.  

**Answer 0**: I would recommend outputting the result of your image print function to a file and compare that with the correct output. It could be that you have an extra whiteline at the end of your output. 
**Answer 1**: This happened to me, so I added an "endl;" at the last line, and it worked out. Hope that helps
**Answer 2**: It did end up being a combination of endls that I hadn't tried yet


# **Question 165**: Hello, how do we compute the energy matrix for matrices where all positions are considered a border (where 1 <= height <= 2 or 1 <= width <= 2) if we are supposed to compute the energy for each non-border pixel?

**Answer**: That's a great question! In that case, you would be skipping the "filling in the non-border pixels" part since there wouldn't be any. You can proceed on to step 3 (note that since the energy matrix has been initialized, it will already be filled with 0s).


# **Question 166**: bash: line 1: ./processing_public_tests.exe: No such file or directory  what does this mean, I received this line in autograder, but i think we do not need to submit processing_pulic_tests    thx

**Answer**: Hi, it looks like the most recent version submitted on autograder does not have this issue. Has this been resolved?


# **Question 167**: For resize, my code runs and executes passing the general "make test" function, it also passes the horse function (at least when compared visually)  Am I done or Do i need to write test cases and such?

**Answer**: No, you do not need to write tests for the computation in the resize.cpp file, but feel free to try the program out on some of your own images! Also, what do you mean by passing the horse tests when you "compare visually"?


# **Question 168**: Hi, my partner and i are currently working on Project Two together. We prefer to work on the project in-person together, and was wondering if we are allowed to use live share as VS code says we have to download an extension. Thanks.

**Answer**: Yes, you are allowed to use Live Share!


# **Question 169**: Regarding Matrix_tests.cpp AND Image_tests.cpp:  There does not appear to be any "greyed out" tests (which I believe are the private tests) for Matrix_tests.cpp and Image_tests.cpp.  Am I correct in inferring that there are no private tests for Matrix_tests.cpp and Image_tests.cpp?  Thank you!

**Answer**: Your test files are used to test for bugs in Matrix.cpp and Image.cpp, so there won't be any private tests for _tests.cpp files. However, writing meaningful test cases in _tests.cpp files to catch bugs in Matrix/Image can help ensure you pass private tests for those. 




# **Question 170**: that if we are working on find_minimal_vertical_seam(), do we need first to identify the cases which there is only one row 1x5 or one column 5x1 or even 1x1, then work on larger matrices like 2x2 or 3x3?  

**Answer**: Yes, you can identify and handle a one-row image in the find_minimal_vertical_seam() function before you deal with images with more than one row. However, handling this case doesn't need to be more than 1-2 extra lines of code. Depending on your implementation, you may not even need to have extra code to seperately handle this case.




# **Question 171**: Since the spec says that "There are two versions of the Matrix_at function to support element access for both const and non-const matrices. The constness of the pointer returned corresponds to the Matrix passed in. The implementations for these will be identical." How should one go about testing these two functions if their code is exactly the same? 

**Answer**: Good question! So remember that while the code within the function body is the same, the return values are necessarily not. Consider the different properties that we want to enforce with each function. What are the different things we should be able to do with the write Matrix_at compared to the read-only Matrix_at?




# **Question 172**: Hello, I can't figure out why my implementation for the cost matrix function is incorrect.  

**Answer**: Hello, Yasmina! Are you failing in the Autograder or your local public tests? If it is the public tests, could you send a picture of the cost Matrix after function returns for the dog tests. One thing (I'm not 100% sure about this) is you may fail to compile in the Autograder because you access the member variables for energy  directly. Even if you don't have issues compiling in the Autograder, you'll definitely want to use Matrix_width() and Matrix_height() functions to get the values you need.




# **Question 173**: Would we get marked off if we have a lot of test cases, and some of them might be the same as other tests but written differently? For example, I am testing a function one way, and then another test indirectly does the same thing, should I worry about making my tests as concise as possible while still being comprehensive or can I just keep all the tests I wrote? Thank you.

**Answer**: Nope! We don't test/take points off for redundant test cases.


# **Question 174**: Hello,  Quick question. For the column of a minimum value, is the column starting at 0 or at 1? For example, if the width of the matrix is 3 and the minimum value is in column 2, should the function return 2 (since that's the column that the min value is in) or 1 (since that's the index of the min value)?  Thank you!

**Answer**: Yes column should be the index of the column in the matrix, so the first column would be column 0.


# **Question 175**: Hello,  As the title says, passing crabster seam carve 50x45 but failing crabster seam carve 70x35. All my other tests say that they pass including all the other crab tests so I'm fairly certain that all the seam carving algorithms should be correct. What could I be missing, please?  Thanks!

**Answer**: Something different about the 70x35 seam carve test case is that its carving both horizontally and vertically, rather than just horizontally or just vertically. It might be worth looking at your implementation of seam_carve() or of your resize.cpp’s main() to make sure you’re resizing width and height correctly. 


# **Question 176**: When I run the test cases in VS code, they pass. Why does the autograder section for "Student Matrix tests on student Matrix" say this fails?

**Answer**: It would depend on your code, but students in the past have had similar issues because the autograder may not always initialize variables to 0. Double check this is the case, as this could cause a similar issue.


# **Question 177**: For remove_vertical_seam in processing.cpp, if we were to copy into a smaller auxiliary Image and then back into the original like it says to, what happens to the last column of the original img that was passed in? If we can't change the width of img, but the values of the auxiliary image are passed into it, it leaves the last column unchanged. What do we do with the last column of img?  

**Answer**: I can understand how this can be confusing, but to specify, you are not really copying the data vector over to the original image. Instead, you are completely overwritting the original image with your new, smaller image. You can do this with the "=" assignment operator.


# **Question 178**:  How should we initialize the RGB values from the PPM file to each color channel? Should we use a function we made in Matrix.cpp?  

**Answer**: To initialize the channels yes, but the RGB values would come from your PPM file input


# **Question 179**: The cost function example uses three pixels in the above row to compute, but the spec says to use all the above pixels. So how many pixels from above should we use when computing it?  

**Answer**: the cost function uses three pixels in the above row to calculate the cost only for the pixel below it; to calculate the cost for the entire row, you would need to reference all pixels from the row above


# **Question 180**: I have an implementation for remove_vertical_seam, but it doesn't pass on the public test, so I tried printing out the image that my implementation creates, and compared it to dog_removed.correct.ppm, and they look identical, however it is still failing. Also, if I run the public test multiple times, it will sometimes show a segmentation fault, or a fail. Is there something I'm doing wrong, or is there something wrong with my ppm files?  

**Answer**: It sounds like there are some bugs in your implementation, but it's really hard to say without looking at your code or getting a little more detail. I would recommend coming to office hours so we can help you further! 

**A segmentation fault means that somewhere you are accessing memory out of bounds. I would start by making sure you aren't grabbing or setting a pixel that is beyond the image's dimensions. The visual debugger can be a good way to locate the exam line that is causing the segmentation fault in your program.


# **Question 181**: Found a segmentation fault when trying to assign the filestream input for r value into the red_channel Matrix, so I included a cout statement in the implementation of Matrix_at() for testing purposes. However, when running the program the debugger reads this statement, performs the return statement, and crashes the program on account of the seg fault without printing anything to terminal. What is causing this, and how can I resolve it?

**Answer**: Please remember not to share your code in a public Ed post as if someone copies it, both you and them will get an honor code violation. I've gone ahead and privated it, but remember to private posts that show your code in the future.

But for the question, you should be initializing the img before accessing any channels. I can't quite see the full function to see if you're initializing it or not, but if you're trying to access an element in a vector of size 0 you're going to get a seg fault.


# **Question 182**: For compute_energy_matrix() function, are will only filling the border of the matrix with the energy or the entire matrix with the energy?

**Answer**: According to the spec this is the implementation for the energy matrix, in the end the entire matrix will be full of values for the energy, but they are computed in several steps as the spec suggests here:

To construct the energy Matrix for the whole image, your function should do the following:

Initialize the energy Matrix with the same size as the Image and fill it with zeros.

Compute the energy for each non-border pixel, using the formula above.

Find the maximum energy so far, and use it to fill in the border pixels.


# **Question 183**: After following the spec and beginning to implement resize.cpp I realized that none of the functions implemented were showing up to "autofill" as normal when typing them in in VSCode, and functions that are implemented in processing.cpp or image.cpp aren't recognized in my resize.cpp file. It says to copy the hello world code into our resize.cpp and to run that and that was it for starter code, but I never saw anything about how to get our functions to work in resize.cpp. Do I have to use #include to include the other files that contain my functions I need to use to implement my driver program? Or is there something that I'm missing?   Also are we allowed to include sstream or fstream?   

**Answer**: Yep, you should include the hpp files that contain the functions you implemented. Yes, you are allowed to include those libraries.


# **Question 184**: Hi,  I'm sorry if I'm not explaining my question well; I am very confused about what to do for resize.cpp. Are we typing the command line arguments into the .json file? Are we checking if the command is valid? If so, how do we read from the command line? I assume "cin" wouldn't do it.   Thank you!

**Answer**: resize.cpp is essentially the driver for your entire code. You want to call resize.exe, pass it some command line arguments, and have it perform the resizing. This means resize.cpp should contain the code to read in the command line arguments and call functions from processing.cpp to do the actual resizing.

For reading in command line inputs, refer to argc and argv. 


# **Question 185**: Hi,   My processing is passing all the public tests in VS code. However, it is timing out in the autograder, any idea why?     Thanks

**Answer**: It's a bit difficult to tell without additional detail. My recommendation would be to first use perf to identify where your code is taking up the most time. The tutorial is linked below. This will help you identify which part of your code is leading to delays.
https://eecs280staff.github.io/image-processing/perf.html



# **Question 186**: Hello, if I'm only done with matrix.cpp, can i submit that to the autograder and will it tell me if it's correct? Or do I need to finish all the files to get that feedback? 

**Answer**: I submitted matrix.cpp when it was the only thing I had worked on and the autograder gave me feedback. It worked fine.


# **Question 187**: For the processing.cpp, I can compile and pass all public tests. However, in autograder it shows something error and I've attached the problem that I meet below. Can I add #include "Image.hpp" in Proccessing.cpp to make it contains the struct Image? 

**Answer**: If you look at the name of this test, it's called "Check respecting Matrix and Image interfaces in processing.cpp". By directly accessing the member variables of an Image (e.g. red_channel, green_channel, blue_channel), you're not respecting the Image interface.




# **Question 188**: I have some [problems like this about interface. I am confused because the struct of image atually has the member width. i also include image.hpp in my processing.cpp....

**Answer**: #282


# **Question 189**: What is the purpose of dog_removed_out.ppm? Does that mean if my implementation of remove vertical seam looks like that, there's an error?

**Answer**: The dog_removed_out.ppm contains the contents of an image after your implementation of remove_vertical_seam() is called on it. You'll see that there is also a dog_removed.correct.ppm file. We generate these files for your ease of debugging. The implementation of your remove_vertical_seam() function is likely correct if dog_removed_out.ppm has the same contents as dog_removed.correct.ppm .




# **Question 190**: For cost matrix, the spec told us to do this:  Initialize the cost Matrix with the same size as the energy Matrix.  Fill in costs for the first row (index 0). The cost for these pixels is just the energy.  Loop through the rest of the pixels in the Matrix, row by row, starting with the second row (index 1). Use the recurrence above to compute each cost. Because a pixel’s cost only depends on other costs in an earlier row, they will have already been computed and can just be looked up in the Matrix.  I want to clarify that in the third bullet point, each value of Matrix[i][j] will be the least cost of the energy of the rows above? 

**Answer**: This means for a given cost Matrix cell (Matrix[i][j]), you will look in the row above it and see three cells: one directly above (Matrix[i -1][j]) , one in the upper left  (Matrix[i -1][j-1]), and one in the upper right (Matrix[i -1][j+1]) -->hence the image in the spec that describes the Pixels above. You will find the minimum value from those cells. You will also find the value at the same location ([i][j]) in the energy Matrix. You will add the minimum value to the energy value and that will be the cost value for our given cost Matrix cell (Matrix[i][j]).

Now, of course, not all cells in the cost Matrix have exactly three cells "above" them (i.e. border cells). Think about these edge cases: How can you tell which cell is a border cell? What are the two cells above a given border cell and how would you access/index them?

Let me know if this helps and if you have any other questions. 


# **Question 191**: While I initially had some assertion errors that were sorted out and eventually ran the processing public tests, I noticed that all of my dog tests passed (including the seam carve for that one) whereas that was not the case for the seam carve tests for the crabster.ppm and horses.ppm image files. Where to best start in addressing these failures?

**Answer**: horses and crabster are much bigger images that create a lot more opportunities for unintended behavior-- i would either print out your carved image and the correct carved image or use your visual debugger to see what the differences are and work from there.


# **Question 192**: Hi, I am confused on how to remove the vertical seam. If I can't change the width of the image after removing the seam, what happens to the last column? How does the image change size otherwise. Additionally, is it necessary to use a nested for loop to remove the vertical seam.   

**Answer**: Yes you are correct that you can't change the width of an image after it is created. The way to implement this function is to define a new image of the right width, and then copy all of the pixels except for the ones that are apart of the seam to be removed to it. After copying you set the original image to the new image you defined.


# **Question 193**: When testing processing_public_tests, crabster cost fails, and it accesses energy values that don't even exist in crabster_energy_correct.txt. For example, in index row 6 col 1 in my crabster_cost.out.txt, the value is 5350, despite the energy value in that index being 0 and the cost values in above index row 6 col 1 being 7800 3900 3900. It's confusing because test_1 dog cost passes, but the crabster and horse cost fails. Is there a bug?  

**Answer**: It's hard to tell without seeing code, but first, ensure that you are following the spec to a T, I had a similar thing were my cost matrix was incorrect on all images, as I had an issue and couldn't figure it out until I realized in writing my implementation I was trying to go through the wrong matrix and wasn't following the spec. 

If it is only crabster that is giving you issues, it was mentioned before in an earlier thread that crabster tends to catch a lot more edge cases than the other image files. You could check to make sure your image init is initializing it correctly in the first place, check you aren't indexing out of bounds, and check that you are trying to access the right rows and columns as per the spec. A staff member might be able to help you further by actually being able to see your code, but that is at least a few places to check.


# **Question 194**: Hi, what dors the part of the effect in the RME for matrix_init function mean when it says "with all elements initialized to 0? Isn't the matrix initialized to the height and width provided as parameters?  

**Answer**: The individual elements within the matrix should be set to 0 (meaning internally, the data vector should have 0s)


# **Question 195**: I wanted to clarify an edge case for compute_energy_matrix since I've seen different answers from different SIs.  When either the width or height of an image is less than 3 (< 3), do we fill the entire energy matrix with the maximum energy value computed from the image, or do we fill it with 0s since the Energy(x) function is mathematically undefined (due to missing N, S, E, W neighbors)?  My reasoning is that even if we cannot use direct neighbors (N, S, E, W), we can still compute differences between adjacent pixels in the image. This would suggest that the energy should be based on the maximum pixel difference in the image rather than defaulting to 0.  Could you clarify the expected behavior for this case?

**Answer**: Good question! It should be filled with zeros. Here's how the algorithm should go in this case: The matrix will init to all zeros, then the algorithm will loop over all non-border elements to compute energy (none in this case), then we find the max value from the matrix is zero (since no elements were updated) so that is what our border should be filled with.


# **Question 196**: While running the public test for dog test remove seam, the height changed from 5 to 4 right before iterating through the last row. I tracked using the debugger and cout, but it just suddenly changed the height from 5 to 4 when Image_set_pixel in Image.cpp was calling Matrix_at during the last row iteration. So now, the assert to check row boundaries in Matrix_at is returning false because row 4 = height 4.   

**Answer**: The remove seam function should only modify the width as we are essentially removing a column. I would go through and ensure you are not accidentally modifying the height, or passing in the wrong variables to Image_set_pixel or Matrix_at. If you are still stuck on this issue, adding your uniqname is helpful so someone can look at your autograder, or you can always head to office hours!


# **Question 197**: Hi, do rows and columns of matrix start at 0 or 1. I doin't mean the index, but the actual row. Like if I want to get the first element of the matrix, would I use row =1 and column =1 , or row =0 and column =0?

**Answer**: The first element would be row=0, column=0.

Ex: Matrix A = [1, 2

                           3, 4]

To get to the number "1", it would be row=0, column=0




# **Question 198**: If I am trying to run processing public tests on the terminal, and the tests are taking forever to run, is this a runtime issue? How should I approach this? 

**Answer**: It's normal for the tests to take some time, however the autograder does have a timeout. There's a few suggestions in the spec for improving code runtime. This includes reducing unnecessary copies of Image structs, and making sure not to use a loop in Matrix_at(). If these are still not working, I would suggest using Perf to see which of your functions is taking the longest time to complete. There's a good tutorial on the website I've linked below. This tool will be extremely useful in EECS 281!
https://eecs280staff.github.io/image-processing/perf.html


# **Question 199**: Hello,  My code times out in the autograder when resizing horses.ppm. I am trying to trouble shoot this using perf, as recommended in the project specs. But when I try to use perf in my terminal, I get this message: zsh: command not found: perf  I am on an intel mac, in case that helps.  Thank you!  

**Answer**: That output happens because you do not have Perf installed on your machine. Perf is already installed on all CAEN computers and that's generally the easiest way to use it - most students ssh in from the temrinal. I'm not quite certain if Perf can run on Macs or not. My guess is no since it is generally a Linux tool and I would recommend using CAEN.

# **Question 200**: I don't understand how the mutation tests work. I've heard that our written tests are put up against bad code.  Are we supposed to guess what parts of the code could be written wrong and write a test to catch that?   How am I supposed to know what parts are coded in wrong in the bad code?  As an aside, what's the process to figure out edge cases? I can only think of basic cases, but I can't think of edge cases for any of the functions. I don't remember learning this in lecture.

**Answer**: You are supposed to be writing test cases for all of the functions that you are writing in both image and matrix.cpp, if you write tests that sufficiently test your matrix and image functions you should be able to get all of the points for those. In terms of edge cases, as it was said in a different thread #196, an edge case for these matricies could literally be testing a number on the borders or corners of a matrix. But as long as you are writing tests that make sure the function you wrote is behaving properly you should get the points. Also if you miss points the autograder will show you how many you missed, and will give you hints as to how to solve them.


# **Question 201**: I'm comparing the following files to make sure I finished processing.cpp & resize.cpp correctly:   1. horses_400x250.correct.ppm  2. horses_400x250.out.ppm  3. horses_400x250.ppm  The numbers in horses_400x250.correct.ppm are identical to that inside of horses_400x250.ppm. However, those values are very different from those in horses_400x250.out.ppm. How should I go about interpreting this?   

**Answer**: Update: I ran this in the terminal: 

make resize.exe ./resize.exe dog.ppm dog_4x5.out.ppm 4 5 diff dog_4x5.out.ppm dog_4x5.correct.ppm

Now all three are the same. Does this indicate my processing.cpp & resize.cpp files are correct? Otherwise, how do I go about writing additional test cases? 


# **Question 202**: The spec says to "First, find the minimum cost pixel in the bottom row" when implementing the find_minimal_vertical_seam function. Does this mean we have to call compute_vertical_cost_matrix to do this? And if thats the case, how would that work if we need a energy matrix as a parameter, when find_minimal_vertical_seam only utilizes cost matrix?

**Answer**: When implementing the find_minimal_vertical_seam function, you can assume that the compute_vertical_cost_matrix has already been called. Note that the input to find_minimal_vertical_seam( ) is the cost Matrix. You can assume that the cost Matrix has already been correctly set by calling computer_vertical_cost_matrix( ). 


# **Question 203**: I need to ssh to CAEN linux for the style check. Do I ssh to uniquename@eecs280.engin.umich.edu? Also, what would be my login id for ssh?  

**Answer**: You would ssh to uniqname@login-course.engin.umich.edu (don't replace login-course with eecs280). Then, it should prompt you for a password which is just your umich email password, and then Duo push.


# **Question 204**: I saw that after running the tests all of the .ppm files and some .txts became untracked according to github as they were modified. If I wanted to rerun anything, how can I revert them to their original version so I can remodify them? I don't want to commit any changes to these files. Thank you!

**Answer**: I believe that the processing_public_test file when it runs the tests, creates new files, and those are probably what you are seeing as untracked. Like a file such as dog_4x5.out.ppm is not given to us in the starter code, and you can see which files we were given in the project spec. You can also confirm this by bringing up your github and comparing the files you have from your last commit to see if it just created the new files and those are the untracked files. 

The new untracked files will just get modified by your code whenever it gets run, so if you have an error in your code and run a test, and you correct that error in your code and test again, the tests will just overwrite what is already in those files. I commited all of those new files to my github repo and have had no issues, so you should be good to commit all of your files and don't have to worry about rolling back the files it creates since it should just overwrite them when you test.


# **Question 205**: The number printed by the resize.cpp is correct, but the the format(specifically newlines, the output goes to the next line at unexpected place) is unexpected. The rest of file passes all of the test. Is there any potential reason that could cause this format issue?

**Answer 0**: Image_print is the most likely culprit. I would double check to make sure you are using the correct indices for rows and columns. 
**Answer 1**: It is solved, I should convert the argv to int instead of dereferencing it. 


# **Question 206**: Given the ostream argument, do we need to open that file and assert that it is open? Or are we assuming that it is already open?

**Answer**: It's good practice to assert that it's open. 


# **Question 207**: Hi,  I’m having some trouble with my Matrix_max function. I didn’t pass the autograder test cases, so I added a test case with a matrix that contains all negative values. However, it still didn’t pass, and I’m not sure what I did wrong.  I made sure not to initialize max_value with 0. Instead, I set it to *Matrix_at(mat, 0, 0), so I thought it should correctly compare negative numbers as well. But for some reason, my function still doesn’t work as expected.  Here’s my implementation:  // REQUIRES: mat points to a valid Matrix // EFFECTS:  Returns the value of the maximum element in the Matrix int Matrix_max(const Matrix* mat) {   assert(mat != nullptr);   assert(mat->width > 0 && mat->height > 0);     int max_value = *Matrix_at(mat, 0, 0);    int width = mat->width;   int height = mat->height;    for (int r = 0; r < height; r++) {     for (int c = 0; c < width; c++) {       int current_value = *Matrix_at(mat, r, c);        if (current_value > max_value) {         max_value = current_value;       }     }   }   return max_value; }   TEST(test_matrix_max_special_cases) {   // Case 1: Matrix with all negative values   Matrix mat1;   Matrix_init(&mat1, 3, 3);   *Matrix_at(&mat1, 0, 0) = -10;   *Matrix_at(&mat1, 1, 1) = -20;   *Matrix_at(&mat1, 2, 2) = -5;   ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_max(&mat1), -5); }   ** Test case "test_matrix_max_special_cases": FAIL In ASSERT_EQUAL(Matrix_max(&mat1), -5), line 124: 0 != -5    Could you help me understand what might be going wrong? I’d really appreciate your guidance.  Thank you!

**Answer**: When you do Matrix initialization, we set it up so that all default values are set to 0. So unless you're changing every single value in the matrix to be less than 0 (which you are not), the maximum value in your matrix will be 0. Your code is behaving correctly, it's just that the test assertion is incorrect :)


# **Question 208**: Hi, the requires clause for Matrix_min_value_in_row function includes "0 <= column_start && column_end <= Matrix_width(mat)". I am bit confused why is it allowed that the column_end could equal Matrix_width(mat). Wouldn't this be indexing out of bounds? 

**Answer**: This is because the second argument when you are finding the min value in a row is exclusive! So if you wanted to find the min value all the way through the end of the row, you'd have to pass in the index "after" that last one, which would be the one = to Matrix_width(mat)!


# **Question 209**: Our resize public test fails for the dog_4x5.out.ppm file in autograder because it says there is "no such file or directory", but we can see the file in vscode and it is outputting the correct matrix. We tried not closing output stream but got the same error. How should we fix this?

**Answer**: Delete the dog_4x5.out.ppm file and run your program again. Does it still create the file with correct output?




# **Question 210**: For the image tests, I am using the unit testing framework, but I'm getting this error message on the autograder: unit_test_framework.hpp:612:60: error: static assertion failed: types cannot be compared with == and !=. I'm confused as to why I'm getting this message and how I can fix it 

**Answer**: If you want to compare Pixels or Images, you need to use the helpers we give you in Image_test_helpers.hpp.


# **Question 211**: The RME's for most functions only say "valid images"  

**Answer**: I believe this should be answered with the same answer that was given in #192 that not everything can be tested, so in reality there isn't really a way to make sure that img is a valid image directly.

After re-reading, and a slight edit, some of the RME's for the processing.cpp files should assert that the image isn't empty and would fail out if the image was empty. For remove_vertical_seam there is an RME to assert that the width of the image is greater than or equal to 2, and since the processing.cpp runs all of the implemented functions, it wouldn't be able to skate through all of the functions without it catching an empty image. As for the other functions that only have a "valid images" RME, I believe what I stated above is the case, that not everything can be checked.


# **Question 212**: Do we include requires clauses as assertions in our Matrix.cpp functions or do we test for them? If we don't test for them do we keep them in our functions? Because they cause the program to abort and I'm not sure if my test cases are valid then.   

**Answer**: You should include them as assertions. Remember, from RME, the function requires that the input to the function follows the statements in the requires clause, so you wouldn't need to test input that breaks the requires clause.  


# **Question 213**: I'm confused about the image_fill test, as I've used the loop as the hint said, but it just still can't pass the test on autograder.  

**Answer**: Shumeng, this test looks like a great start. If you still haven't caught the bug, think about how you can add another test that evaluates other behavior expected from the Image_fill() function. Let these additional test(s) be meaningful in that they test behavior different from existing tests you've written. For example, you could try writing a similar test where width != height for the respective Image. Note that I or other GSIs/IAs do not actually know the bugs, so this will take a little bit of trial and error.




# **Question 214**: I uploaded on autograder too if any of the staff is able to see, but I have been spending all day with my partner and I trying to get this test to pass but it just wont. Regardless of the change I have put in my functions this is the error I am getting: "processing_public_tests.exe: Matrix.cpp:71: int* Matrix_at(Matrix*, int, int): Assertion `column >= 0 && column < mat->width' failed."  The thing is, I am pretty confident in that function and I do not see how that memory gets leaked out. I have the sanitizer thing but I cant find where this all starts from and how to fix it. This is the last thing we have to do before the resize and then were all done so it's just very frustrating. Any help would be appreciated.  UPDATE: I FOUND IT. IT WAS ALL IN THE IMAGE_INIT ALL ALONG. In my nested for loop there was height being iterated both times instead of height and width

**Answer**: I had a similar issue except with my assert statement in my matrix_init function instead, check all of your dog, horses, and crabster.ppm files to make sure that they aren't blank, in my attempted testing of my resize.cpp I had accidentally wiped my dog.ppm file giving me an error very similar and I clicked on the dog.ppm that I was testing with and it was blank, it was due to a mess up on my part when testing my attempted resize.cpp implementation, but when I ran it with a different file it was fine.

 Also instead of running the entire processing public tests at once, maybe try running individual tests like this if the files aren't blank to see if it is a single test that is giving you trouble.

Along with that you can also try to use the visual debugger to figure out if your image is being initialized or holding the values that would cause this error, especially by putting some breakpoints in the matrix_at() function to check the values that are being passed in and might be giving you the error, then you might want to work your way backwards to where that matrix at is being called, and figure out where the values aren't being set correctly to cause your assert to fail out.


# **Question 215**: I need to include the processing and image hpp files right?   

**Answer**: Yes, because that's where the function prototypes are, which you have to use in resize.cpp


# **Question 216**: for the private test cases on autograder, do we have to write out test cases for our functions like we did in project 1? Or will the autograder just run the tests on the code we have written in each non-test file?

**Answer 0**: Hmmm, I'm not sure I understand your question. In P1, recall that you had to write your own test cases in a _tests.cpp file, but there were also autograder private tests run after the deadline. The same goes for P2.


**Answer 1**: Correct me if I'm misunderstanding your question, but the private test cases on the autograder are the greyed out ones which will be run on your program's implementation. To ensure your program works as intended, you should write your own test cases. The test cases for Matrix and Image are run on the mutation testing suites which is where we run your test cases on buggy implementations of project code. To do this, you can follow the unit testing framework, similar to how you did in project 1. The only difference is now you are graded on how many bugs you catch, rather than just having a test file. Here's a reference from the spec with more details on that: 



Feel free to follow up if this didn't answer your question!


# **Question 217**: Hello, for image_init I am having trouble understanding how to intialize the image, especially the matrix red channel, blue channel, and green channel? Any tips or clues?  I have tried setting each member equal to matrix_init and then passing the member, width, and height as parameters but it doesn't compile.

**Answer**: The best hints I can give is to take a look at this portion of the spec (specifically the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs of the linked image implementation section), it gives a lot of hints how to implement the Matrix functions you wrote in Matrix.cpp even if they aren't directly stating how to call matrix_init. Also, your thinking of using matrix_init is on the right track as stated in the spec, so keep looking in that direction, and take a look how the given test function (test_fill_basic) in Matrix_tests.cpp uses matrix_init() and how you might use a similar matrix_init() in image_init() to initialize your color matrices like the spec suggests.


# **Question 218**: Hi, after finishing resize.cpp and passing the general "make test", do I have to write extra resize_tests.cpp to make private tests? Since I noticed that the autograder has private test section for resize, which includes about 6 tests.  

**Answer**: The only test cases that we have to write are Matrix_tests and Image_tests, you don't have to write test cases for processing.cpp or resize.cpp. The private tests cases are just for the autograder to run harsher tests against our code (the processing.cpp and resize.cpp files) once the deadline passes, but we aren't required to write any test files for processing or resize. Although you can still test your code on your own using the command line and executing your ./resize.exe and then your arguments and the provided .ppm and correct.ppm files to ensure functionality.


# **Question 219**: Whenever I test the Matrix_print function, the text and whitespace seemingly match up wo the example string, but it always fails the test. Even something as simple as the given test on Matrix_public_tests.cpp will alwyas fail even though I have checked the whitespace more times than I can count. Is there something else that could be triggering a difference in the strings?

**Answer**: NEVERMIND I FIXED IT I WAS USING STD::COUT INSTEAD OF OS LIKE IN THE PASSED PARAMETER SO IT WAS PRINTING JUST FINE BUT DIDN'T GET ADDED TO THE OS STREAM




# **Question 220**: Hello.  My resize function keeps throwing up the build in error: "Usage: resize.exe IN_FILENAME OUT_FILENAME WIDTH [HEIGHT]2WIDTH and HEIGHT must be less than or equal to original."  This does not get thrown when I run the code myself in vscode.  I'm wondering what argv's the Autograder is submitting for the Resize Public Test.  I'm not sure why this error would only occur in the autograder.  Am I supposed to build default arguments if none are provided somehow?

**Answer**: I would try to run your code in VS code with both 4 and 5 arguments in the command line, and also checking your logic for error checking against the rules for your driver program. I would run your code for example with the command line:

./resize.exe dog.ppm dog_4x5.out.ppm 4 5

and ./resize.exe dog.ppm dog_4x5.out.ppm 4

The autograder might be checking with both 4 or 5 arguments, and your error checking logic might be getting hung up whenever it uses one vs the other or inputs a certain height and width. Also make sure your argv[] values for height and width is following the rules, as this also might be where it could be getting hung up, and ensure that for checking your argv[] values in your error checking that you can input all values that fit within the rules, so maybe check with your command line in VS code that you can input the maximum and minimum allowed values for the height and width to check your argv[] error checking logic.


# **Question 221**: hi, I was looking at hte project specs in the image module and I saw this: "Other than variance in whitespace (not all PPM files put each row on its own line, for example)". What does this mean and do we have to account for it in a special way? 

**Answer**: It basically means that you can't expect a new line to be in the right place (end of a row of pixels). The best way you can account for this is to use the >> operator. It skips over all whitespace and so you just need to implement your reading in a way that iterates through your image properly.


# **Question 222**: Hello,  For the Image test cases, I was wondering if we should consider out-of-bound Pixel values for our edge cases. For example, could a person enter negative values for a Pixel's rgb values, or would this break the requires clause and therefore we don't have to test for these pixel values in our test cases (are pixels required to be within the 0-255 range)? Thank you!  

**Answer**: We won't be testing for anything that doesn't fit the requires clause.


# **Question 223**: I have a question regarding the required error messages in resize.cpp. The project spec states that we should print: cout << "Usage: resize.exe IN_FILENAME OUT_FILENAME WIDTH [HEIGHT]\n" << "WIDTH and HEIGHT must be less than or equal to original" << endl; exactly as written, whenever an error occurs.  However, I’ve structured my error checks separately: One if statement checks the number of arguments. Another if statement validates that width and height are within the valid range.  Would it be acceptable to print: cout << "Usage: resize.exe IN_FILENAME OUT_FILENAME WIDTH [HEIGHT]\n" << endl; for the argument count check,   and then separately print: cout << "WIDTH and HEIGHT must be less than or equal to original" << endl; for the dimension check?  Or does the spec require that both lines always be printed together regardless of the specific error?

**Answer**: Both lines should be printed every time regardless of the error. You don't need to restructure your code to check everything at once though, just copy the exact same error message everywhere.


# **Question 224**: I am getting an error on my debugger when running processing_public_tests.exe  //  I am not sure how to address this. All of the files from the initial project file have been added to Xcode.  Please Advise

**Answer**: #168, the last answer. Let me know if it doesn't work.


# **Question 225**: Hello, I am still a bit confused as to how the test are graded? We are headed on how many bus we catch, so do the tests we make are supposed to catch bugs and fail? 

**Answer**: It's like they have some bad code, and when they run our tests on the bad code, the tests should find errors. We don't know what the bad code is, but we can make tests that check for common errors or edge cases


# **Question 226**: When I run my resize.exe I get this error: p2-image-processing(87052,0x202c43840) malloc: nano zone abandoned due to inability to reserve vm space.  Error opening file: dog.ppm  Program ended with exit code: 1  however this error does not occur in autograder so I am assuming its something on my system so I was wondering if anyone else has gotten this problem or know how to solve it. Thank you.

**Answer**: Are you using VS Code or XCode?


# **Question 227**: I’m really stuck on my Image_fill function. I’ve tried so many test cases, but I still can’t figure out what’s wrong. I feel like I fully understand the hints, but my implementation isn’t passing the tests.  I’ve carefully checked my logic, but no matter what I try, it doesn’t seem to work correctly. I’d really appreciate any guidance on what I might be missing.  Here’s my implementation:  // REQUIRES: img points to a valid Image // MODIFIES: *img // EFFECTS:  Sets each pixel in the image to the given color. void Image_fill(Image* img, Pixel color) { assert(img != nullptr); assert(img->width > 0 && img->height > 0);  for (int i = 0; i < img->height; i++) {   for (int j = 0; j < img->width; j++) {     assert(0 <= j && j < img->width);      assert(0 <= i && i < img->height);     Image_set_pixel(img, i, j, color);    }   } }  Could you help me understand where I might be going wrong? Thank you so much for your time!

**Answer**: Great work! Seems like this was resolved :)


# **Question 228**: Do we need to catch all the bugs for matrix_tests.cpp and image_tests.cpp to get full credit? is there a certain amount that satisfies the requirement? 

**Answer**: you need to catch at least 8 bugs in Matrix_tests and at least 11 bugs in Image_tests for full credit!


# **Question 229**: // REQUIRES: energy points to a valid Matrix. //           cost points to a Matrix. //           energy and cost aren't pointing to the same Matrix // MODIFIES: *cost // EFFECTS:  cost serves as an "output parameter". //           The Matrix pointed to by cost is initialized to be the same //           size as the given energy Matrix, and then the cost matrix is //           computed and written into it. //           See the project spec for details on computing the cost matrix. void compute_vertical_cost_matrix(const Matrix* energy, Matrix *cost) {   Matrix_init(cost, energy->height, energy->width);    //  Set first row with energy values   for (int j = 0; j < cost-> width; ++j) {     *Matrix_at(cost, 0, j) = *Matrix_at(energy, 0, j);   }    for (int r = 1; r < cost-> height; ++r) {          for (int c = 0; c < cost-> width; ++c) {           int energy_val = *Matrix_at(energy, r, c);            int min_cost;            // No left diagonal exists           if (c == 0) {             min_cost = Matrix_min_value_in_row(cost, r - 1, c, c + 2);           }           // No right diagonal exists           else if (c == cost->width - 1) {             min_cost = Matrix_min_value_in_row(cost, r - 1, c - 1, c + 1);           }           else {             min_cost = Matrix_min_value_in_row(cost, r - 1, c - 1, c + 2);           }            *Matrix_at(cost, r, c) = energy_val + min_cost;     }   } }  Hi, this is my cost function! I am getting the follow output, which isn't right. Since, only two of my values are wrong, I believe my mistake is when I'm setting the index. However, I can't determine which indexes I set incorrectly. Can you please help me?  

**Answer**: Looking at your code, I believe you're missing an extra conditional statement for min cost. There could be 4 possible calls to Matrix_min_value_in_row depending on the parameters you need to pass in. For a hint, you'll need an extra else if --> what should be plugged into the function if c is 0 and no right diagonal exists?


# **Question 230**: In for loop, do we always need size_t rather than int? Will we loose mark by using int? (I think some compile will give error when using int, but some will not)

**Answer**: You can use int. It's up to you which one you use.


# **Question 231**: Hi all! I've been getting this error quite a lot and any guidance on what it means and how to fix it would be quite helpful. I've tried Googling information to no avail and I'm not very strong yet with the terminal so I might be commanding wrong? Any help would be much appreciated!

**Answer 0**: In your line you aren't including an executable like Matrix_tests.cpp, so that might be it. 

However, I had this same issue and even when I put in the executable it didn't work. I fixed it by instead running "make matrix_tests.exe", which basically runs the same g++ thing but with added flags which made it compatible with this project. 


**Answer 1**: This error means the linker hasn't found a main function. You're only compiling and linking Matrix.cpp, which has no main function. Doing "make Matrix_tests.exe" will compile Matrix_tests.cpp (has a main function) and Matrix.cpp.
**Answer 2**: The student answers are accurate - always compile your code using the instructor provided makefile in 280! (A makefile essentially provides more detailed and exact instructions for your compiler, the g++ command you included may be missing some important parts)


# **Question 232**: dog_removed.correct.ppm is matching my output when I print my results for remove_vertical_seam for dog.ppm, but it fails the test in processing_public_tests.cpp. I don't think it's my Image class, that passes all of my tests. What could be causing this?

**Answer**: Can you give us a bit more information on what the output looks like when you try diff on the two files? What does the error message show you when you run the processing_public_tests.exe?


# **Question 233**: Hello, I saw in #288 the following response: "Yes you are correct that you can't change the width of an image after it is created. The way to implement this function is to define a new image of the right width, and then copy all of the pixels except for the ones that are apart of the seam to be removed to it. After copying you set the original image to the new image you defined."    I am a bit confused as to how to do the last part: set the original image to the new image. From what I understand, using a pointer and setting it to the new image is not allowed in this case. How else could I do it?

**Answer**: The last part is actually allowed. Notice that the remove vertical seam function is not returning anything. The goal is thus to modify the input img pointer so that it points to the new image.

I've been at this one issue for hours, and I cannot figure out this bug, someone please help or give me some kind of direction.  Thank you for your time and help,

**Answer**: Hi, we're unable to debug your code through Ed. If you would like 1 on 1 help with your code, please come to office hours. The first step to debugging this may be to step through the function with your debugger or print out the cost matrix, since dog is a relatively small test case.


# **Question 235**: Printing in public Matrix tests keeps failing even though I'm quite certain the spacing is the same. I've also tested different variations of spacing and nothing makes it pass.     My code for reference:     os << mat->width << " "  << mat->height;    for(int i = 0; i < mat->width * mat->height; i++)   {     if(i % mat->width == mat->width - 1)     {       os << std::endl;     }      os << mat->data.at(i) << " ";    }    return;

**Answer**: Try moving your if statement to come after os << mat->data.at(i) << " ". 


# **Question 236**: When I run processing public tests, dog and crabster are instantly pass all tests, but then for horse, it runs very slow, and for first 4-5 tests it passes but then it is really slow and sometimes does not even give the result for a very long time.

**Answer 0**: This is quite normal, it took a while for mine too, especially with my cout statements for debugging. Without them it finished in about 3 minutes or less. But check your Loops for anything that could be causing any continuous loop. Look for any edge cases.
**Answer 1**: It it takes too long your code may time out in the autograder. Use perf (you may have to use the CAEN servers to test this) to identify areas in your code that is taking up too much time.

# **Question 237**: Can we create a helper function in Matrix_tests.cpp to help us test functions that require const matrix?

**Answer**: Sure! Helper functions are always a good idea to reduce code duplication and save you time when programming


# **Question 238**: I submitted my project yesterday, and got 68/68.   I see a section called Mutation testing suite, where they gave me two hints (one hints per each Matrix and Image cpp file)   Hint 1 for "Matrix Bug 3"  Matrix_max() - Your tests fail to catch a bug in this function.  Hint 1 for "Image Bug 3"  Image_fill() - Your tests fail to catch a bug in this function.  Can you clarify what these hints are for? I was a little confused because my submission rn passes all the mutation tests, yet I don't know why they told me that it fails to catch a bug.   Also, if it fails to catch a bug, do I need to re-implement the. function? or the test for that function?

**Answer**: These hints are available to every student, regardless of the number of bugs they've caught already! The more submissions you use, the more hints that will be available to you — they're just there to help point you in the direction of tests to write to catch certain bugs. If you have an 8/8, you're all set!

Also, if a test fails to catch a bug, that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad test. It just means that it didn't find any of the bugs in the buggy program the Autograder tests against.


# **Question 239**: I got these errors in processing.cpp running the public tests and I have tried everything to fix it--can someone tell me where I am going wrong

**Answer**: Check your compute_vertical_cost_matrix, for each call to Matrix_min_value_in_row remember that col_end is exclusive.


# **Question 240**: I keep getting this error when I try to run resize.cpp, and it seems like Image_init isn’t reading in the width and height correctly as it says they are both 0 when I debug, but I cannot figure out whether there is an issue with the way I am reading in data from the ppm file or if it’s a different function. I would appreciate any help!

**Answer 0**: Some things that I would check are that your file is actually being opened and accessed and are being passed into your init function correctly which is my best guess. Check how you might be using fin and check that fin is open before your init function is implemented to ensure that you are actually reading the file before initializing and the assert failing. If all of your other tests in the project pass, it is probably something to do with how you are reading in your file to resize and not another function since the tests you made and all of the public tests should ensure basic functionality for your other functions.

I would take a look at this portion of the lecture notes, this should give you a good idea of how to take in your file and ensure it's correct, and I asked a question yesterday to my lab IA and he said that argv[] is just a C style string, so similar to in the lecture here argv[] would be equal to filename. Then you can use fin similar to how ss_input is passed into the Image_init in the other lecture notes that I pasted below since the other chart shows that we can pass multiple types of inputs into the reference of istream which is what Image_init takes in, including being able to take in ifstreams.



Although I had the same error during my resize implementation, and my error might be a special case but I accidentally wiped my dog.ppm file and deleted the data on accident while I was trying to test my resize and it gave me the same error since it wasn't able to read the height and width since it was obviously blank. My case is probably not the issue, but it is at least something to check to narrow it down and something you might not immediately be inclined to check.
**Answer 1**: It looks like you're reading from the file before you call Image_init, which would cause issues.


# **Question 241**: For the case where we are given an image where the resized dimensions do not change, should we include a condition where we return 0 or is that unnecessary?

**Answer**: You don't need a special case in your code - your seam carve loop just wouldn't run because the Image_width is the same as the new width




# **Question 242**: What is the long lines style check? We haven't passed it yet but I don't understand what the autograder is checking for ? 

**Answer**: Setup Style Checking | EECS 280 Tutorials

# **Question 243**: unique name: xmei  I started Project 2 rather late and realized I ran out of autograder submissions opportunities for today. Is there anything I could do before the deadline to submit the debugged version of my code?  

**Answer**: Hi Xiaohan! Unfortunately, we are not able to offer more submits beyond the 3 submits a day, as mentioned in the EECS280 syllabus. We will use the submission that received the combined best score. 


# **Question 244**: ‘struct Image’ has no member named ‘width’. This is the error I am getting in my code and I don't understand it because image has a member named width that we call ? Why won't it work for the tests?

**Answer**: It's a bit hard to diagnose bugs like this without seeing anything. I would suggest making a private Ed post showing your code, or coming to virtual office hours today. However, you should be accessing the Image width with the function Image_width() rather than directly.


# **Question 245**: Hello, My resize.cpp program is failing the Autograder test despite passing all tests locally. More specifically, the Autograder seems to not see any output from the resize.cpp file. However, when I run the tests locally, resize.cpp works just fine. Any recommendations on where to look for the issue?

**Answer**: i would try running with a sanitizer and see if that catches any undefined behavior! programs and frameworks can behave unpredictably with undefined behavior, which is why it might be fine on your end, but AG is super strict about it.

# **Question 246**: It is saying this, and we tried to get all the cases, but could not after trying several times. Please help

**Answer**: The IAs don't know what each of the bugs are, however I took a look at your last submission. You are not checking any edge cases for the Matrix_column_of_min_value_in_row() at the column boundaries as hint 2 specifies. I would suggest specifically testing for when a minimum value is at the column boundaries of the matrix and the function parameters.




# **Question 247**: Hi, I kept getting this error when testing for almost all the cpps.   Assertion failed: (0 <= column && column < Matrix_width(mat)), function Matrix_at, file Matrix.cpp, line 62.  But I'm not sure how to revise it. I think I am following the RME, but there must be something wrong.. 

**Answer**: The reason we have the assertions here is so when you fail to follow the RME, the debugger is able to inform you of where and why this is happening. To fix this, I would set up your visual debugger - which will automatically pause at a failed assertion. From here you can determine which parameter is violating the requires clause. I would recommend checking out our debugging guide, or coming to virtual office hours today.

# **Question 248**: Are we graded on our comments for project 2? We passed all the style checks on the autograder, but will there be a separate grading for how good our comments are? 

**Answer**: Nope, there is no hand grading, if you pass the style checks on the autograder, you're all set with that.




# **Question 249**: If I got all points on the students tests but there are still hints appearing, does this mean there are still bugs I didn't catch? 

**Answer**: Yes. But note that there are more bugs than points. You do not need to catch all the bugs to earn all the points, and catching more bugs won't give you more points once you have full credit.


# **Question 250**: Hi, any lat tip on a special ase that I should account remove_seam function? Like any additional if statement that I should have or cosnider. My code is complete, but that fucntion is causing the asserts of getting and setting image pixels functions to fail.  

**Answer**: Without seeing your code it's quite tricky to diagnose this issue. I would suggest making a private Ed post with some more information or heading to our virtual office hours today.


# **Question 251**: My VS code will compile processing.cpp and run it without any issues, and has passed all the public tests. When I submit on autograder, it will not compile and gives the following errors, despite none of them being applicable in my code:    processing.cpp: In function ‘void seam_carve_width(Image*, int)’:  processing.cpp:235:46: error: ‘cos’ was not declared in this scope   235 | compute_vertical_cost_matrix(energy_mat, cos | ^~~ processing.cpp:235:49: error: expected ‘}’ at end of input   235 | compute_vertical_cost_matrix(energy_mat, cos | ^ processing.cpp:228:42: note: to match this ‘{’   228 | for (int i = 0; i < iteration_num; ++i){ | ^ processing.cpp:235:49: error: expected ‘}’ at end of input   235 | compute_vertical_cost_matrix(energy_mat, cos | ^ processing.cpp:225:49: note: to match this ‘{’   225 | void seam_carve_width(Image *img, int newWidth) { | ^ make: *** [public.mk:68: processing-warning-check.s] Error 1

**Answer**: I took a look at your code on Autograder. It seems to end abruptly. Try downloading processing.cpp and looking at the very bottom of the file. This cut-off would cause the errors you mention.


# **Question 252**: Hello, I was told to do a private post and add more info on this:  Hi, any lat tip on a special ase that I should account remove_seam function? Like any additional if statement that I should have or cosnider. My code is complete, but that fucntion is causing the asserts of getting and setting image pixels functions to fail.    This is how my code looks for the function:   

**Answer**: Image_init() should be called with the width first, then the height. You are currently calling it with height first, then the width. Very minor error that could cause a big slip up. 


# **Question 253**: im so incredibly confused and frustrated. i can open the files in vs code, but i cannot see Linux in my explorer to select anything. i had no issue submitting to the autograder previously but i'm not sure how to submit or how to fix this issue. i tried restarting my PC and now im googling a bunch. 

**Answer**: If other things don't work, from terminal, you can copy the files from whatever directory they are in to mnt/c/users/[username]/... which is your windows directory


# **Question 254**: I keep getting this error and I don't know how to debug. The debugger is just saying assertion failed but I dont know where

**Answer**: This output is saying that in Image.cpp at line 112 your assertion is failing. I would suggest setting a breakpoint for this test case (test_seam_carve) in processing.cpp so you can then walk through the test case and see why the assertion is failing.



I also would note that width tells us how many columns there are while height tells us how many rows there are. 


# **Question 255**: Because of the weather advisory alert for snow on Saturday is there a chance of the Euchre social being moved to Sunday?   

**Answer**: No, luckily it'll be on Central Campus, so it should be easy for most students to get to!


# **Question 256**: When will private test grades be available?

**Answer**: They're out!


# **Question 257**: Does this error: Card.cpp:121:17: error: non-member function cannot have 'const' qualifier  mean that we have to remove the 'const' from the: Rank get_rank() const assert(false); {}

**Answer**: No, the const should stay. get_rank() should be a member function of the Card class. So if you're declaring the function outside of the class, it would look something like: 

Rank Card::get_rank() ...




# **Question 258**: Hi,  This is my first time working with overloaded operators. I understand that we can make operators do what we specify in their overload functions, but I was wondering how we should test this. Is it similar to testing functions, or are there other considerations that I should be aware of? Any help is appreciated.  Thank you.

**Answer**: Hello! You can use the unit test framework like in previous projects. Use the assert TRUE or assert FALSE functions to check if the comparisons are correct. Consider card1 (Ace of the trump suit) and card2 (Jack of the trump suit). card1 > card2 should resolve to false. So, in this case you would use ASSERT_FALSE(card1 > card2) to test. I hope this helps!




# **Question 259**: For the void shuffle() function, should we call the Pack() function to order the pack from lowest to highest rank before shuffling? Or do we just shuffle without ordering the pack?

**Answer**: If this question is referring to Pack::shuffle() , you should not be calling Pack() to order the pack from lowest to highest rank before shuffling. Shuffle the cards without ordering the pack. :)


# **Question 260**: Suit Card::get_suit(Suit trump) const  Does this function return the next suit of the trump?  Ex: trump is SPADES so the function will return CLUBS

**Answer**: The function Suit Card::get_suit(Suit trump) const will return the suit of the card given the trump. If the trump is spades and this function is being called on the Ace of Diamonds, the function should return DIAMONDS. Note that there is a special case where a card's suit changes depending on its rank, suit, and the trump suit.


# **Question 261**: For the card comparison operators like <, <=, >, >=, ==, !=, are we only comparing the rank of the cards and not considering the suit at all?

**Answer**: Card comparison operators should consider both suit and rank. According to the specs, Diamonds > Clubs > Hearts > Spades. For rank, Ace > King > Queen > Jack > ... and so on. I would highly recommend looking at the card visuals as a reference for comparisons.


# **Question 262**: What does lhs and rhs stand for in the operation overloading functions?

**Answer**: lhs: left hand side, rhs: right hand side. It's a shorthand to describe the values on the left and right of the operator respectively. 


# **Question 263**: Hi,  When testing any const function in project 3, should different cases use const and non-const objects? Additionally, should we check that an object's member variables are not changed if testing on a non-const object?  On a side note, when considering cases for testing should we make different cases for every potential suit and rank? I was wondering if there is a concept to apply here that is similar to the small-scope idea that we followed in the previous project.  Thank you.

**Answer**: should different cases use const and non-const objects?

Sure!

should we check that an object's member variables are not changed if testing on a non-const object?

I personally don't think this is necessary, because if you try to modify member variable in `const` function, compiler will throw an error before you test it.

 when considering cases for testing should we make different cases for every potential suit and rank

Probably not EVERY potential suit, but I definitely encourage you to think of all special cases - like left/right bower, trump, face/non-face card, etc. Consider how these special cases impact each stage of the gameplay.




# **Question 264**: Overall game.

**Answer**: Some of the specifics of how we want you to code up your project are specific to us, so if you want to play online or watch videos to understand the game better, make sure to pay close attention to the spec.


# **Question 265**: The EECS 280 website says that the euchre social is located in the Jeff Blau Hall while Ed says that the Euchre Social is located in the Mason Hall. Can you please confirm the location of the euchre social and its room? 

**Answer**: It's in BLAU 1570 (Jeff Blau Hall). 


# **Question 266**: For the functions such as add_and_discard, lead_card, play_card, how do I write test for those functions? Those functions print output to the command line and also takes input from the command line, does that mean I should use cin and cout to test those functions?

**Answer**: You don't need to take input from command line in order to call these functions. Here's an example from Player_public_tests.cpp :

  bob->add_and_discard(
    Card(NINE, HEARTS) // upcard
  );


In terms of testing the effect of these functions, you don't necessarily need to compare the printed output with correct output. Instead, you can think of what effect does these function calls should have on player's hand, and add assertions based on that.







# **Question 267**: If two non-trump cards are of equal rank in Card_less() are ties broken by suit?

**Answer**: Yes


# **Question 268**: Hi, I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding the <= operator properly. Since < checks for both rank and suit to determine the card values, what's the point of checking if lhs and rhs are the same card if we know that all the cards in euchre are unique? Is it just because it's good to have a <= operator defined? Thank you!

**Answer**: For euchre, it may seem like the <= and == operators are not necessary. However, it's practical to have all the logical operators completed for the card.hpp and card.cpp suite. It ensures consistency if this code was ever exported to another program that utilizes card logic. In this program, there might be a case where the <= or == have importance and need to be implemented.

For euchre, there might be a case where cards are not unique. There's a pack input, meaning that you can (realistically) put in any set of cards, including duplicates. It might be a fun test case to write :)


# **Question 269**: In the case where the simple player would be picking up a card (dealer and round 1), are we supposed to call the add_and_discard function from make_trump? It seems reasonable but I got errors trying to implement probably because make_trump is const and you would be calling a modiyfing function. Or is this something that we would do later in the euchre driver and there's no need to call it now?

**Answer**: Managing things like that is something that you will implement in the driver.


# **Question 270**: our makefile doens't seem to be working for any of the arguments we pass through it  

**Answer**: Are you in your p3 directory? Make sure your terminal is in the same directory as your makefile and cpp files.


# **Question 271**: While I was writing the implementation for the second pack constructor function, the one where we take an istream as an argument, I noticed that, when I tried to use istringstream to help break the task down, I keep getting an "incomplete type istringstream is not allowed".    Does this mean that we should not be using istringstream to help set up the cards array? 

**Answer**: You're probably missing #include <sstream>. Though, is there a reason you're using a stringstream instead of  the istream directly?


# **Question 272**: Do we need to implement friend std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &is, Card &card);  If so, I'm a bit confused on how to write the function stub in Card.cpp.  

**Answer**: You do have to implement it, just like the other operator functions. The whole "friend" thing doesn't matter, that just means it has access to certain data. 


# **Question 273**: when I return this, do I return literally   return trump;    or do I return the trump suit? (Example if its diamonds I return DIAMONDS)

**Answer**: You should return the suit of the card object it’s being called on, considering how the Trump suit affects the suit of the card (i.e. If card is Jack of hearts, card.get_suit(DIAMONDS) returns DIAMONDS)


# **Question 274**: Hi, I'm a little confused about why this gives an error. Since this friend function is part of the Card class, shouldn't you do the player Card:: thing? I included some other functions I implemented for Card to show what I mean. It also doesn't work when I add std:: in the implementation (a photo is also attached)  Could you explain what was wrong? Thank you!

**Answer**: There’s actually a difference when you use the friend keyword in a class. Rather than saying, “this function is one of the member functions of the Card class,” it says, “let this outside function access the private members of the card class (the function itself is not a member of the card class)”. You’ll need to remove the Card:: before your function stub for your implementation, since the function is not part of the card class. You’ll also need to remove the friend keyword in your implementation, since it’s just something you use inside the class’s friend declaration.


# **Question 275**: Hi, I have a question on the ordering in the correct euchre output for euchre_test01.out.correct. Most of my output is correct but my differences are slightly confusing.   First difference in bold, strikethrough because error cascades.  Correct Hand 1 in euchre_test01.out.correct  Hand 1 Fran deals Nine of Diamonds turned up Gabriel passes Herb passes Edsger orders up Diamonds  Ace of Clubs led by Gabriel Nine of Hearts played by Herb Nine of Clubs played by Edsger Queen of Clubs played by Fran Gabriel takes the trick  King of Clubs led by Gabriel Queen of Hearts played by Herb Ace of Hearts played by Edsger Jack of Clubs played by Fran Gabriel takes the trick  Queen of Spades led by Gabriel Ace of Spades played by Herb King of Diamonds played by Edsger King of Spades played by Fran Edsger takes the trick  Jack of Hearts led by Edsger Nine of Diamonds played by Fran Ten of Clubs played by Gabriel Jack of Diamonds played by Herb Herb takes the trick  Ten of Diamonds led by Herb Ace of Diamonds played by Edsger Ten of Spades played by Fran Jack of Spades played by Gabriel Edsger takes the trick  Edsger and Gabriel win the hand Edsger and Gabriel have 3 points Fran and Herb have 0 points   My output:  Hand 1 Fran deals Nine of Diamonds turned up Gabriel passes Herb passes Edsger orders up Diamonds  Ace of Clubs led by Gabriel Nine of Hearts played by Herb Nine of Clubs played by Edsger Queen of Clubs played by Fran Gabriel takes the trick  King of Clubs led by Gabriel Queen of Hearts played by Herb Ace of Hearts played by Edsger Jack of Clubs played by Fran Gabriel takes the trick  Queen of Spades led by Gabriel Ace of Spades played by Herb King of Diamonds played by Edsger King of Spades played by Fran Edsger takes the trick  Jack of Hearts led by Edsger Ten of Spades played by Fran Ten of Clubs played by Gabriel Ten of Diamonds played by Herb Edsger takes the trick  Ace of Diamonds led by Edsger Nine of Diamonds played by Fran Jack of Spades played by Gabriel Jack of Diamonds played by Herb Herb takes the trick  Edsger and Gabriel win the hand Edsger and Gabriel have 3 points Fran and Herb have 0 points   The lead card is hearts, trump is diamond. Fran doesn't have any cards that match hearts, so they will play the lowest card. Why are they playing 9 diamonds when they have a 10 of spades (diamond is trump). Similarly why is herb playing the jack of diamonds if he has 10 of diamonds.

**Answer**: Ok, I saw the explanation; it is because Jack of Hearts is a diamond, my b. 




# **Question 276**: for both card_less functions, can we assume that the cards will not be the same card because there are no duplicate cards in the deck of 24 cards? So card a will not equal card b? Thanks!

**Answer**: Correct, the function will only return true or false. No two cards are equal


# **Question 277**: Hi, is it okay to include <string> in our card.cpp file? Thanks!

**Answer**: Yep, you can. Note that the <string> library is mostly useful for string manipulation functions. You can still declare a string variable type without the string header.


# **Question 278**: For the pack() default functions are we only allowed to use one array for the 24 cards individually since there is one array in the class? If so are we allowed to look up how to split strings into words based on certain elements so we can make it work?  Otherwise Are we allowed to split Card element into multiple arrays or?

**Answer**: Pack is already defined to have one array (cards) in the .hpp file, so you are only allowed to use one array for the 24 cards in a Pack. I am confused on why you would need to split strings into words, as the array stores Card objects, which have functions that allow you to retrieve their rank / suit. It might not be necessary to do so :)


# **Question 279**: Hi,  I'm a little confused by what reset is supposed to do, are we just setting int next to 0?  Thanks  

**Answer**: Yep, that's correct.


# **Question 280**: For the overloading of functions I had questions about the value system. Are we comparing the rank first (A > K > Q > J > 10 ...) then the suit?

**Answer**: Yep, you should first compare rank and then compare suit if the ranks are equal.


# **Question 281**: When testing Player.cpp, how do we access the cards a player has after we have changed it with something like add_and_discard? Since cards is a private vector and there is no function that would return the cards a player has, what is the best way to go about accessing them?

**Answer**: I would recommend creating a helper function that will check the cards that a player has in their hand. Think about how a function like lead card or play card can be used to extract a card from a player's hand. Just remember that if you remove a card from the player's hand during testing, you'll need to add it back as well. Follow up if you have further questions!


# **Question 282**: Do we Have to write test cases for pack? I assume since we are not submitting them we are given the choice, if it turns out to be buggy wont we find out either way in Euchre.cpp?

**Answer**: Euchre only uses a specific subset of cards from a full deck, but Pack.cpp is able to work with a variety of different sets. So just using Euchre.cpp as a way to test won't be enough. Also, it will be very annoying to write Euchre.cpp if you're still unsure of the correctness of Pack.cpp.




# **Question 283**: Do we assume that the simple player abides by the rules of Euchres? For example, if they have a card of the same suit as the upcard, they won't place a card of a different suit? Or, do we have to implement this fact?

**Answer**: For Simple Player, you have to implement their behavior according to the spec. The behavior in the spec already follows the rules, so there shouldn't be any rules being broken by a Simple player.




# **Question 284**: Should I be using asserts inside my member functions of the Card class to verify that the input parameters such as (Suit trump) are valid Suit types, or is that redundant since it is an enum type?  

**Answer**: Yes, because it is an enumerated class, this is not needed.


# **Question 285**: How do I test my shuffle function if the point of shuffle is that it generates a random order?

**Answer**: Shuffle doesn't generate a completely random order. Shuffle mixes the card in the same way each time, outlined in this section of the spec. 


# **Question 286**: Hi,   For some member functions, I think it would make sense to not make them virtual. For example, both the Simple and the Human player would have a name, so could we make that a function of the Player parent class?   Thanks!

**Answer**: You don't submit Player.hpp to the autograder, so you can't change it.




# **Question 287**: Hello!  My partner and I are a bit confused about whether or not certain card combinations count in 'Card_less()' functions based on our Euchre knowledge.   For an example on what I mean:   Function 1 (no leading): Suppose both A and B are non-trump aces. Which wins? Is it that they are the same, so A !< B since they are tied (aka return false)?   Function 2 (with leading): Suppose both A and B are not trumps and not leading suit (aka off-suit), but different values. In euchre, this means that neither card wins and therefore A !< B (so return false).   Is my logic correct, or should we return the lower-rank card even if it doesn't follow the euchre rules? If so, how would it handle those cases where the card suit is different but the rank is the same?  

**Answer**: In the simplest case, cards are ordered by rank (A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9), with ties broken by suit (D > C > H > S).

For your first question, you need to look at A and B's suit.

If a led suit is present as well as a trump suit, the ordering is the same except that all cards of the led suit are considered more valuable than all non-trump-suit, non-led-suit cards. Note that it is possible for the trump suit and led suit to be the same.

For your second question, you simply return true if A has higher rank, return false if B has higher rank




# **Question 288**: Hello! For deal_one the requires states that cards must remain in the deck.   1. If there are no more cards remaining in the deck, does this mean that the next index would be equal to the PACK_SIZE? If so, should we add that as an assertion?    3. Should we check if next equals PACK_SIZE (or the end of the deck) after we increment it, and reset it back to 0 if necessary, or will this be covered in later functions?    

**Answer**: 1. Yes, next should be less than PACK_SIZE. You may add that as an assertion if you wish.

2. You should not reset the value of next in Pack::deal_one(), this should only be done by the Pack::reset() function.


# **Question 289**: For the "name" assignment in return for the function, it says out of scope, how I make it in-scope?

**Answer**: Which function is this error occuring in? You might want to check where your variables are being declared to ensure they don't go out of scope before returning. 


# **Question 290**: for the subclasses, is it okay to define function inside the class? or should we still define them outside the class using this "::" operator? 

**Answer**: Either is fine as long as it compiles and runs properly.


# **Question 291**: in function: std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &is, Card &card)  do we always assume that the input is in the format of "Three of Spades",  both suit and rank start with capital letter and then lowercase, and have "of" in between? or we need to write more detail to make sure that the input is in this way, otherwise, report error?  thx

**Answer**: yes I believe that is standard output 

[Rank] of [Suit]

With Rank and Suit being titled.


# **Question 292**: So the spec says "If the trump suit is ordered up during round one...)" but this is nowhere to be found in the requires clause, Do I still need to implement the add_and_discard function within the bounds of round 1, or is that not necessary?

**Answer**: The functionality of add_and_discard is separate from making trump, meaning you don't have to worry about the current round when implementing. The round is something to consider when writing euchre.cpp.


# **Question 293**: Hi, should we include tests for our implementations of the overloading operator functions? if so do we use assert_true for the bool functions? How can we test the ostream/istream ones then? Thank you.

**Answer**: Yes, you should include tests for these. You can use ASSERT_TRUE or any other assert in the unit test framework for this.

For the stream operators, you should be able to use stringstreams, similar to how you used them in P2 to test Image_print and Image_init. 




# **Question 294**: The project spec seems to imply that we should prompt the human player to input any suit during the ordering up making trump process.   "When making trump reaches a Human Player, first print the Player’s hand. Then, prompt the user for their decision to pass or order up. The user will then enter one of the following: “Spades”, “Hearts”, “Clubs”, “Diamonds”, or “pass” to either order up the specified suit or pass. This procedure is the same for both rounds of making trump."  So, if the up card is of the diamonds suit and the human player choose clubs, should an error be thrown? Could a simple "order up (y/n)" line be used instead of allowing the player to choose a suit?  The spec also says "You may also assume the user will follow the rules of the game and not try to cheat." Does this mean that we can rely on the autograder/Human Player to always choose an acceptable value? Meaning, for example, if the up card is of the diamonds suit (and its the first round) the player will never choose anything but diamonds or "pass" despite the option being presented to them? And similar for the second round, except allowing both diamonds and hearts as well as pass as options for the player to choose (will not choose spades or clubs).

**Answer**: You can assume all input a human player is given is valid. The situation you describe above would be an example of invalid behavior since the human player would be violating the rules of euchre (if you're talking about the first round of making trump-- note that it would be valid during the second round). 




# **Question 295**: Does the default constructor pack(); return a pack of 52 ordered cards or only the euchre pack of 24?  

**Answer**: The euchre pack.


# **Question 296**: I saw another post that said we should make helper functions to access private member variables in Player.cpp like hand for easier testing. However, I am a little confused on how to do this without being able to modify the .hpp file. If I try just defining the function in the .cpp it tells me that Player * does not have that function in Player_test.cpp. Thanks!

**Answer**: If I try just defining the function in the .cpp it tells me that Player * does not have that function in Player_test.cpp

Hard to say without looking at your code, but my best guess is because you're trying to define the function as part of the player base class, not the simple player or human player subclass. Try just making the helper function for the subclasses and see if that works.


# **Question 297**: In the slides describing the simple player strategies, it says that in round 2 of making trump, the dealer can no longer take the upcard.  I wanted to clarify what this means.  Does this just mean they cannot order up?  Thank you.

**Answer**: In the first round, the if anyone orders up, the dealer can decide whether or not to replace a card in their hand with the upcard.
In the second round, the dealer cannot replace a card in their hand with the upcard if someone decides to order up.

So the dealer can order up in the second round. Does this clarify things?


# **Question 298**: I just want to clarify if we need to implement the human player derived class for the checkpoint or is it only simple?

**Answer**: Both simple and human players! Most of the effort is in simple players, but part of the checkpoint involves passing the player public tests which have some human player functionality.


# **Question 299**: Multiple of the requires clauses mention that player should have less than 5 cards for example. But my question is how do access this hand variable since it does not exist in the hpp class. Do we have to add a variable to the hpp or is there a different method to doing that.

**Answer**: Good question! In Player.hpp is your "Player" base class, and you would have to create derived classes (namely "Simple" and "Human" derived classes). Since you are in charge of writing these classes, feel free to add whatever member variables you deem fit. 




# **Question 300**: Hello,  I had some questions when I was implementing the Simple class    1) If the led suite and trump suite are same, do we consider the left bower as following suit? Or would they play the lowest card in their hand?  2) If jack is the only card you have in led suite but that is the left bower, should u still play it?   Is the left bower SOLEY considered the trump suit, or is it also considered in the led suite?    Thanks  

**Answer**: 1) If the led suite and trump suite are same, do we consider the left bower as following suit? Or would they play the lowest card in their hand?

The LB is always considered part of the trump suit (not the suit that is printed on the card itself), so if the led suit is the trump suit, playing the left bower would be considered following suit. (this is a great edge case to test for simple player!)

2) If jack is the only card you have in led suite but that is the left bower, should u still play it? 

Not sure exactly what you mean by this question. Let me know if this situation describes it:

Trump is diamonds, and someone leads with hearts. You have the Jack of hearts (and no other cards that have hearts on them). Because trump is diamonds the Jack of Hearts is the LB. If you play the Jack of Hearts, this would not be considered following suit because the left bower is the suit of the trump suit (so your jack of hearts is actually considered a diamond). 

Does this help?


# **Question 301**: i saw that on another thread that for the human make_trump() function, that the human player gets to input something on both round 1 and round 2 of making trump.   my question is about the "screw the dealer" variant. if the human player is the dealer and round 2 makes it all the way to them, do they still have to input the suit of the same color or can they just input anything? Or do we have to manually check the condition that they are the dealer and then order up the suit of the same color for them, in which case, the human user doesn't input anything?  also, when we're printing the cards in the human player's hand, before we add or discard an upcard, can we assume their hand is already sorted and we only need to sort after they add or discard a card? Or do we need to sort their cards just in general cause their hand will not be sorted? 

**Answer**: my question is about the "screw the dealer" variant. if the human player is the dealer and round 2 makes it all the way to them, do they still have to input the suit of the same color or can they just input anything? 

The human player can declare any suit, except for the upcard's suit. However, you can assume that all input to the human player will be valid, so there is no need to check that the selected suit doesn't match the upcard. the human player implementation is essentially a bunch of reading input and not much else in terms of game logic


when we're printing the cards in the human player's hand, before we add or discard an upcard, can we assume their hand is already sorted and we only need to sort after they add or discard a card? 


You should sort the hand whenever there is a change to the hand (adding or discarding cards to the hand).


# **Question 302**: Hello, the test cases in Pack_public_tests are failing for these functions. I cannot figure out why my implementations are incorrect. 

**Answer**: For shuffle, check your loop using "small_index".

In the first loop where j = 0 and small_i = 0...

card[0] = deck_2[0]
card[1] = deck_1[0]


In the second loop, where j = 1 and small_i = 0...

card[1] = deck_2[1]
card[2] = deck_1[1]


As you can see, there is some overlap that may be causing bugs in your program. I suggest using a debugger to see the final result of your shuffle :)


# **Question 303**: When the player has no Cards with the led_suit, and they must play the lowest card, this has to factor trump in right?  Like if player has all trumps; lowest trump.  If player has no trumps, just regular operators to check smallest  if player has mix of trump and regular, take only regular, get lowest  Correct?

**Answer**: This is all correct. 

Your card_less function should take care of all of this logic between comparing cards in reference to the trump suit. Your play card function, however, needs to decide whether to play the max card of the led suit, or if that is not an option, the lowest card of non-led suit.


# **Question 304**: Hi,  when submitting to autograder, I fail Player public tests and get this error:  Player.cpp:6:10: fatal error: Pack.hpp: No such file or directory 6 | #include "Pack.hpp" | ^~~~~~~~~~ compilation terminated. make: *** [public.mk:35: Player.o] Error 1  Is there something I am missing? What can I do to correct this?

**Answer**: Do you need anything in Pack inside Player? The autograder is likely throwing an error because Pack.hpp is not necessary for the functions in Player. If you are not using those functions, remove the include "Pack.hpp".


# **Question 305**: When I try to launch my debugger, I receive this error:  "the platform is not currently connected  Possible cause: the working directory "/Users/muskanrekhani/Documents/GitHub/P3-EUCHRE" is missing or inaccessible."  So far, I have attempted to type ls into my terminal to see if the files exist, and they do. Here is my json file:  {     // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.     // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.     // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387     "version": "0.2.0",     "configurations": [         {             "type": "lldb",             "request": "launch",             "name": "Debug",             "program": "${workspaceFolder}/Card_tests.exe",             "args": [],             "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"         }     ] }

**Answer**: It's a little difficult to find the cause of the issue without being able to see everything taking place in VSCode, so feel free to come to office hours if you're still having trouble with this.

I would first check to make sure that the workspace folder (the folder you opened in VSCode when you opened your project) is the same folder you are in on the terminal, and is also the same folder that has your Makefile and all of your euchre code. This is also the folder where your .vscode folder and launch.json should reside. (All of these locations should match).

Everything in your launch.json looks good to me.


# **Question 306**: for human player,  do functions Card lead_card(Suit trump and Card play_card(const Card &led_card, Suit trump) mean, we human choose whatever card they want, and we assume they follow rules and their inputs are valid, so the only job we have to do in the coding is to read the input and remove that card from hand and return the chosen card?  i am not sure whether this understanding is correct or not, or we need to add more limitations on these 2 functions.   thx  

**Answer**: Yep, exactly. For the Human player, you can assume the entered inputs are valid, so you only have to read the input and remove the card from their hand.


# **Question 307**: I'm doing Human Player, am I allowed to assume that the user will only enter pass, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades, and Hearts?

**Answer**: Yes, you can assume that all input from the human player is valid. This is included in the spec: "The Human Player reads input from the human user. You may assume all user input is correctly formatted and has correct values. You may also assume the user will follow the rules of the game and not try to cheat."

Post #414 also provides some more detail on this.


# **Question 308**: Can we include the cmath library?

**Answer**: Yes, that's fine


# **Question 309**: When writing test cases, will we get points taken off for using ASSERT_EQUAL(true, ______) instead of ASSERT_TRUE(); since it is technically more efficient or does it not matter?

**Answer**: ASSERT_TRUE is more intuitive so you should use that. I don't think there would be a difference in efficiency though, and it wouldn't affect your points.


# **Question 310**: Does this function also invoke screw the dealer or not?

**Answer**: I think post #414 explains this well. Essentially, you don't need to include logic to invoke screw the dealer on the human player because you assume that the human player plays the game correctly. If the human player is the dealer and they are asked to make trump on round two, they should know that they cannot pass. 




# **Question 311**: In the bool Card_less(const Card &a, const Card &b, const Card &led_card, Suit trump) function can the led_suit be equal to the trump suit? Thanks 

**Answer**: Yes, the led suit could be the trump suit!


# **Question 312**: When I am adding stub to Card.cpp and make Card_public_tests.exe, terminal writes private field 'rank' and 'suit' is not used. I am wondering where I ignored.

**Answer 0**: We probably need a little more information to give you a helpful answer. Do your functions in card.cpp access rank and suit? If not, then that is your issue.
**Answer 1**: Make sure you created a constructor for Card and are initializing the private variables rank and suit. 


# **Question 313**: "During round two, a Simple Player considers ordering up the suit with the same color as the upcard, which would make that suit trump. They will order up if that would mean they have one or more cards that are either face or ace cards of the trump suit in their hand"  Just to be clear, when you say "if they have one or more cards that are either face or ace cards of the trump suit"  here the alleged "trump" suit means the suit the same color as the upcard right?  For example, the upcard is hearts, my functions checks if i have at least one KQA and left/right bower of DIAMONDS, correct?

**Answer**: Yes, they would consider making diamonds the upcard in round two if no one ordered up hearts in round one, so checking for at least one of:

Ace of Diamonds

King of Diamonds

Queen of Diamonds

Right bower (Jack of Diamonds)

Left bower (Jack of Hearts) 

should be correct!


# **Question 314**: Does false positives mean that my implementation is wrong?

**Answer**: False positives mean that a test case that should not pass on a correct implementation passed on your code, so it is likely a problem with your implementation. You can also check your test cases to make sure you didn't violate the requires clause of the particular function.




# **Question 315**: How should I test add_and_discard if there's no function that can help me see the player's cards?

**Answer**: One way to check is by using the play_card function to deal the player's hand. There should be five cards in the player's hand, so using play_card five times should result in dealing the entire player's hand. Additionally, the play_card function returns a Card, so that can be used to check if the player has actually discarded/added the correct card to their hand.


# **Question 316**: With the comparison operators, would the == operator only be comparing rank since there will not be an equal card with both the same rank and suit? and on the other comparisons, how would this work

**Answer**: Think about using the == operator for test cases. In a test case, you may be using == to see whether the pack has dealt one card correctly to a player. A written test case has the pack dealing the Jack of Hearts. However, the pack (due to a bug) has dealt the Jack of Spades. If only rank is compared, the operator would return true. However, this is not what we would want in our implementation as the two cards are different.

For all operators, you will need to keep both rank and suit in mind. I suggest looking at this image to see the card comparisons: 

Top left is the most powerful card; bottom right is the least powerful card.




# **Question 317**: When writing make_trump(), do we need to consider if the player has >=2 cards with the same suit as the upsuit before ordering up? For both the human and simple player.  

**Answer**: For a human player, no. Human players use inputs to determine whether they make a suit trump. For a simple player, follow the algorithm in the specs.

For a simple player:

Round 1: If they have 2+ cards that are either face/ace of the trump suit, they will order up the suit of the upcard.

Round 2: If they have 1+ cards that are either face/ace of the same color of the trump suit, they will order up.


# **Question 318**: Hello,  So if I make trump during the first round and the dealer, as a simple player, picks it up, this would be handled by the make_trump function, correct?  So would it be ok to change the function from const to a non-const function or are we going to deal with this externally in euchre.cpp?    Thank you,  Ethan Tilak

**Answer**: The player class should have a function called void add_and_discard(const Card &upcard) . This function should handle the logic for picking up the upcard in the first round and discarding a card as needed. Make_trump should only modify the order_up_suit. 


# **Question 319**: When the spec says something like  "If a Human Player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making, the Human Player will pick up the upcard and discard a card of their choice. ."  but  void add_and_discard(const Card &upcard) has no parameter for round  does this mean I have to somehow figure out round number and assert its round one, or no?  

**Answer**: You don't need to worry about round number within add_and_discard as the function should only be called only when round==1. 


# **Question 320**: "Pro-tip: Make “sorted card ordering” a representation invariant of your Human Player class and ensure that the hand is always kept in sorted order. For consistency with autograder test cases, the cards in a human player’s hand must always be printed in ascending order, as defined by the < operator in Card.hpp.  Use the STL to sort a vector<Card> hand:"  is this telling me to call the sort functionality before at the top of each function implementation, or somehow declare it in private and call it? what exactly am I supposed to do here?

**Answer**: The representation invariant essentially means that the hand should only be valid if it in sorted order. Take a look at the pitfall in the spec as it tells you exactly how you should accomplish this.


# **Question 321**: What is wrong with my debugger?

**Answer**: If you are using VS Code, depending on whether you are using a mac or windows, you should choose either "LLDB" (for mac) or "C++ (GDB/LLDB)" (for windows) to create your launch.json file, and it does not look to me like either of those are the one you are attempting to use. I'd suggest going back and re-following the debugger setup tutorial on the eecs280 website!

https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/debugging_guide.html 


# **Question 322**: Ive went over both function implementations in HumanPlayer class multiple times and I cannot spot the difference, do they have the same implementation in the Human class?

**Answer**: lead_card() will be called when the player is playing the first card in a trick, and then play_card() will be called in all other instances, but you are correct that their implementations are technically the same in the Human class :)


# **Question 323**: Do we modify the Player factory function whatsoever? The spec asks us to create our subclasses at the top of the file, then gives us two functions, but the player factory one seems to be complete, am I missing something?

**Answer**: If you are referring to the implementation for Player_factory that is given in the spec, it is a good jumping off point and correctly handles the case where a Player is of strategy "Simple", but you need to finish implementing it so that it can handle the cases of a "Human" strategy as well as an invalid one (the code for inside of the invalid case is also given in the spec)




# **Question 324**: Hello, I am trying to run my player.cpp public tests but I keep getting this, I have no idea what it means or what to do.

**Answer**: I think we would need to see your Player.cpp and Player.hpp files to identify the issue. Please drop by office hours and we'll be happy to help!


# **Question 325**: Hello,  I am currently working on the Human class and had a question regarding some of the function's input parameters. Because Human dervies it's functions from the base Player class, some of them have input parameters that I didn't think we needed to consider for the Human Player. For example, the is_dealer and round variables in make_trump and the trump and led_card variables in play_card.   Since we are going off the assumption the human would play by the rules, I didn't think we needed to consider these variables as the user would follow the rules. Thanks.

**Answer**: Great observation, I think your reasoning is on the right track! Remember the function signatures between simple and human players have to match so that we can use polymorphism and do stuff like:

Player *s = Player_factory("Bob", "Simple");
Player *h = Player_factory("Alice", "Human");

...

s->play_card(...); // I forget the parameters...
h->play_card(...);

Where both s and h are player pointers. This may mean that some function parameters for the simple player class are not needed for the human player class, but they need to be included for the above behavior to work.


# **Question 326**: Hi   I'm passing the public tests (both in my own terminal and on autograder), but in the autograder it says I have a UB problem, but I can't understand what is wrong (I couldn't understand the error output).  Could some one look at my autograder and explain what is wrong?   Thank you so much!

**Answer**: One potential reason could be that when you are using hands.erase(hands.begin()+index), there's a chance (at least from the compiler view), that you could access incorrect memory locations since there are places where you are not assigning a value to int index when you first declare it. Not a 100% certain but I would recommend fixing that first.


# **Question 327**: for testing play_card, and the left bower is the only card that follow the lead, do we play the left bower? or we  just consider left bower be one of trump cards, and then play the lowest one in hand?    thx

**Answer**: #413 


# **Question 328**: When testing my player cpp, does it make sense to add if classes and assertions against duplicates, or is that just impossible?  Like for add card, if add card is called twice in a row on one same card, what would happen? Should I defend against that, is it impossible for some reason?

**Answer**: Up to you. Might be good for debugging purposes later on, but having two of the exact same card in a deck is not valid input so the AG will not be checking this case. 




# **Question 329**: I'm working on testing a "Simple" player. The issue arises in the following scenario:  The trump suit is Clubs  The lead card is the Ace of Clubs  The player's entire hand consists of trump cards:  Ten of Clubs  Jack of Spades (Left Bower, which is a trump in Clubs)  Queen of Clubs  Nine of Clubs  King of Clubs  Expected behavior: Since the Jack of Spades is the Left Bower and counts as the highest available trump, the player should play the Jack of Spades.  Actual behavior of my program: The player plays the King of Clubs instead.  I am not sure if this follows the rules because I get a false positive, could you clarify if I am writing the test correctly?    Thanks!  

**Answer**: 

Here are your two false positive tests:

from the spec: If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand. Here, bob can follow suit, so they play the highest card that follows suit. All cards in bob's hand are clubs (J of spades is technically considered a club here because it is the left bower). So bob should play the J of spades, not the A of clubs.



Here, bob's highest card that follows suit (and therefore the correct simple player choice) is also the Jack of spades. Can you see why using the same logic as my answer above?


# **Question 330**: I am a little confused about the description for the pack constructor. I know we should be putting the existing array in order of rank for each suit, but is the pack.in the only rank the cards will have? will it only be from rank Nine to Ace each time? or should we be considering all possible rank cards can have?

**Answer**: I'm a bit confused by your question. I'll try to be as comprehensive as possible but let me know if you still have questions. 

For the default constructor (with no input), your pack should contain all 24 cards arranged by their suit and rank (rank should range from nine to ace only). Lower suit first, ordered by their rank, then next suit ordered by their rank and so on. There's a more detailed description in Pack.hpp. 

For the constructor with the input pack_input. pack_input will contain all 24 cards. The cards in the pack will be arranged in the order they were read in. No need to sort this. 

The only ranks cards will have is from nine to ace. Only those 24 cards will be in the pack. 


# **Question 331**: Why is there no getter for hand? I feel like it's just inefficient to not have it? Anyways, from my understanding, we are supposed to use play_cards to test functions like add_and_discard. Could someone speak more to it on how to actually use it for testing. Thank you so much.

**Answer**: Since we're trying to emulate a card game, we unfortunately can't provide a functionality where you can just choose to randomly get a card from someone's hand (that wouldn't be allowed in the game!).

To test these functions, you can set up the player's hand (push the exact cards you want) so that you logically know what card the player must play if they are leading, playing, etc. The public tests gives you a good starting point for how to set this up. Look at lines 76 through 121. 


# **Question 332**: Are we going to be graded on our comments for the Project 3 checkpoint?

**Answer**: No, we will not be checking comments for the checkpoint. The autograder will check for comment length in the final project 3 submission. 


# **Question 333**: For the version of Card_less where we pass in the led card, would there be a special test case for if the led card is the left bower? If so, how would this affect the cards a and b that are passed into the function?

**Answer**: Even if the led card is the left bower, the led suit will still be the 'true' underlying suit for the led card. For example, if the led card is the left bower Jack of Hearts, the led suit will be Hearts. As long as you make sure you are checking the 'true' suit of the led card when getting the led suit, this would not need to be treated specially. 


# **Question 334**: I had a few questions about the derived classes we have to make.  1) It was a bit unclear if we should declare the interface for the derived classes in the player.h file and then implement it in the cpp or if we just do both in the cpp alone.  2) Im trying to implement the simple class, but I am not sure where the players hand comes from, do we create this as a private member? If we do, can we also create member functions for it as well? I am also confused if we should create our own constructor for the classes as well as it wasnt specified in the spec.  Thank you!

**Answer**: 1) Do both in cpp. We don't want you to make any changes to the hpp file as you will not be submitting those. 

2) Yes, you should create the private member variables name and hand. For Simple, you need to override the member functions in the base class, so those functions should be declared and implemented for the Simple class. This includes creating constructors, yes. 


# **Question 335**: Hi,  I’m currently working on the make_trump() function and encountering a segmentation fault error when running the public test. I’ve tried printing the trump suit output to check if the trump for the different rounds is being set correctly.

**Answer**: I don't immediately see anything wrong with the code that might cause a segmentation fault. We would need to look at the unit test as well to identify the issue. Please come to office hours so we can look through the entirety of the code! 


# **Question 336**: Should the pack ctors assign next a value of 0? Otherwise my code isn't working but I don't see anything about it in the spec.

**Answer**: Yes we want to make sure we initialize all of the private member variables in the pack ctors.


# **Question 337**: Hi, we were having issues with writing the Player_factory function. In particular, how to set the name of the Player without an internal private name variable or a set_name function within the class. The code would not have errors if a SimplePlayer or HumanPlayer instance was initialized with the default constructor, but that wouldn't use the name parameter passed into the function. Let us know!

**Answer**: Having an internal private name variable would be a great way to keep track of that information for when you have an instance of HumanPlayer or SimplePlayer. You can then initialize the name variable within your constructors. 


# **Question 338**: What's wrong with my code?

**Answer**: Use the debugger and you'll be able to see where you're getting a seg fault. If you need more help, this is a problem best suited for office hours.


# **Question 339**: I am a bit confused on screw the dealer.  From the spec:   If making reaches the dealer during the second round, we invoke screw the dealer, where the dealer is forced to order up. In the case of screw the dealer, the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the upcard.  Screw the Dealer: When making* reaches the dealer on round two, the dealer must *order up a suit other than the rejected one  So if round 2 of making the trump reaches the dealer, they are forced to order the same color suit and not the other color suits?

**Answer**: Yes, if screw the dealer is invoked the dealer must order up the suit that has the same color as the upcard.


# **Question 340**: Hello!  For the checkpoint due on Feb 24th, do we need to implement anything in the files that are to be submitted? Or do we just have to submit the files once we have set the project up?

**Answer**: The checkpoint runs the public tests and mutation tests, so they should be fully implemented. What files are you thinking of leaving unimplemented?




# **Question 341**: Are we permitted to write our own helper functions for this project? If so, are we allowed to modify the .hpp or will we have to initialize in .cpp?

**Answer**: You can write helpers and we encourage it. You can't modify the .hpp file at all though because you can't submit it to the autograder. So it should be entirely in the .cpp files (and make sure it compiles without error).


# **Question 342**: A little bit confused about the dealer boolean variable. is the simple player will never be the dealer? is the usage for the is_dealer only for the screw part? we don't need to modify the cards in hand, right?  edit: Looks like a simple player can be the dealer

**Answer**: "is the usage for the is_dealer only for the screw part?"

To the best of my understanding, this is correct. Is_dealer is only relevant for simple players, where it forces them to obey the "screw the dealer" rule during Round 2 of making.

From the spec: "If making reaches the dealer during the second round, we invoke screw the dealer, where the dealer is forced to order up. In the case of screw the dealer, the dealer will always order up the suit with the same color as the upcard."


# **Question 343**: For the add and discard card, does the simple player consider the trump when determining the lowest?  For example if I'm the dealer and I have 5 diamonds in my hand, and my opponent ordered up Spades since it's the upcard. Naturally, I would throw away the lowest diamonds I have, even though the upcard is the NINE of SPADES.   Does this logic apply to the simple player?

**Answer**: Unless I'm misunderstanding, the spec already explains this:

"If the trump suit is ordered up during round one, the dealer picks up the upcard. The dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand, even if this is the upcard, for a final total of five cards. (Note that at this point, the trump suit is the suit of the upcard.)"




# **Question 344**: same as above

**Answer**: No, only the Jack of the next suit gets special powers, the rest of the suit is not special.


# **Question 345**: I wrote the function is_left_bower before the function Suit_next and used Suit_next in is_left_bower. Am I able to do that? Since Card.hpp is declared at the top of Card.cpp, I assume this should work?

**Answer**: It should work. As long as it compiles, it's fine.


# **Question 346**: Do we have to create a test case for player constructor and/or player factory

**Answer**: We recommend creating test cases for every function (and every edge case for each function) that you write.


# **Question 347**: For the human player functions in Project 3, should we assume that the player will only give inputs that are legal according to the rules of Euchre? If they, say, select a card in play_card() that doesn't obey the rules of following suit, or choose the same suit as the upcard in Round 2 of making trump, should we somehow enforce the rules to correct these inputs (maybe via assert(false)?), or should we just assume the players will obey the rules?

**Answer**: From the spec: "You may assume all user input is correctly formatted and has correct values. You may also assume the user will follow the rules of the game and not try to cheat." 




# **Question 348**: I have submitted my completed code to the autograder after I had completed all the public tests, but once submitted, my player function wasn't compiling. It tells me there is a 'expected type-specifier before ‘Simple’' in the return line of the 'player factory' function. I had this error prior in my testing but hadn't named my constructor correctly, but fixed that and it fixed my problem. Any ideas as to why it is now popping back up in the autograder?

**Answer**: Did you modify Player.hpp?


# **Question 349**: I am a little bit confused as to what a player should have during this point of implementing simple player. In my constructor, I initialized a private variable (int num_cards=0) as I assumed a starting player should not have any cards yet until the game is implemented. I just wanted to verify if thats true, should we assume that dealing has begun while implementing the derived classes, or if not, should we be doing the dealing in this class?

**Answer**: I'm not really 100% sure if this will answer your question and if it doesn't please let me know! But you should implement the classes in simple player as if they have some cards in their hand. I believe if you look at the RME and the required clause you can see that function won't be called if the player's hand is empty.


# **Question 350**: Hi,  I am not sure why I am getting a false positive error for this test. Also, I exposed 17/17 bugs for player_tests, but 4 of them are false positive. My score still shows 91/91, but will this affect my grade?  TEST(test_right_bower_vs_trump_ace) {     Suit trump = HEARTS;     Card led_card(QUEEN, CLUBS);      Player * bob = Player_factory("Bob", "Simple");     bob->add_card(Card(JACK, HEARTS));     bob->add_card(Card(ACE, HEARTS));      Card card_played = bob->play_card(led_card, trump);     cout << card_played << endl;     ASSERT_EQUAL(card_played, Card(JACK, HEARTS));      delete bob; }   Thanks!

**Answer**: For the checkpoint, the score you see is the score you get. But regarding your issue...

Spec: "If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand."

Spec: "Right Bower: The Jack of the trump suit. This is the most valuable card in the game."


# **Question 351**: The spec for play_card states the following:  "When playing a card, Simple Players use a simple strategy that considers only the suit that was led. A more complex strategy would also consider the cards on the table.  If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand."    However, the image below that shows the card orderings in different contexts has a few more rules that this strategy wouldn't encompass:  For example, if there are no cards of the led suit in a hand but the card with the lowest number is of the trump suit, the Simple Player strategy seems to say that this would be the lowest card and therefore the card to be played, but the image shows that any cards of the trump suit are actually greater than cards of the two remaining suits. In this case, which would I follow?

**Answer**: Can you give a simple example of what you're talking about (i.e. example hand, led suit, trump)?


# **Question 352**: I understand the effects of the Suit_next function but don't know how to start.

**Answer**: My recommendation is to look at how the Suits are configured in Cards.hpp. Think about how the enums work with the suits and how you can use them to get from suit to suit. We cannot give you specific recommendations, but if you have any questions that are more specific please let us know.


# **Question 353**: Hello!  After my partner and I submitted our Pack.cpp to our Autograder, we saw that it failed some of the tests that it passed in our code in the terminal.  When we run the Makefile commands (make Pack_public_tests.exe, ./Pack_public_tests.exe), we get that we passed all of the tests.  However, when we manually put in the compiling lines the Autograder uses   (ex: g++ --std=c++17 -Wall -pedantic -g -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-comment Pack_public_tests.cpp -c -o Pack_public_tests.o g++ --std=c++17 -Wall -pedantic -g -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-comment Pack.cpp -c -o Pack.o g++ --std=c++17 -Wall -pedantic -g -Wno-sign-compare -Wno-comment Card.cpp -c -o Card.o g++ -Wall Pack_public_tests.o Pack.o Card.o -o Pack_public_tests.exe)  Our code no longer passes certain tests even though we have not changed anything in our code. We are not sure if this is an error with our code or something else. How would we fix this and why would this error be occurring is what we are mainly concerned about.   Thank you!

**Answer**: Sometimes, your compiler default initializes variables when you don't, however the autograder does not. So I'd recommend going back through your code and make sure you initialize every variable. I'd make sure to look at your Pack constructor since that's where it seems you're failing on the autograder, and think about what variables need to be initialized in a class constructor.


# **Question 354**: is there a way to have the debugger run with the euchre_test input? when i looked it up i saw that c++ doesn't support stdio as part of a configuration for the launch.json (?) but i figure there has to be a better way than typing it all manually haha. thanks!  

**Answer**: You can add them in as arguments in the debugger like this. Similarly, you can use > for output redirection.


# **Question 355**: I revealed all 17 bugs for the player but had a few false positives, yet I'm still getting 91/91. I'll work on reducing the false positives, but will they impact my checkpoint grade?

**Answer**: For the checkpoint, the score you see is the score you get. 


# **Question 356**: I am a little confused on playing with all trump suit cards:  If you do not lead, and cannot follow suit (because they have no cards of the led suit), they play the lowest card in their hand, even if all their cards are trumps?  If you do lead and have all trump suit cards, play the highest card in your hand?  

**Answer**: From the spec:

When a Simple Player leads a trick, they play the highest non-trump card in their hand. If they have only trump cards, they play the highest trump card in their hand.

If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.

So the answers to your questions are yes and yes.


The Simple Player must always follow suit (and play the highest card of the followed suit), and if they can't follow suit, they must play their lowest card.


# **Question 357**: I've written over 40 test cases for player.cpp. But, I still have only found 13/17 bugs. I know we are limited to 50 cases total for a test file and I cannot think of what edge cases I am missing. Do you have any advice on how to figure out what I am missing?

**Answer**: Make sure you're writing a test for every function. I recommend thinking of scenarios in the game that change with order of card and how that may impact functions. For example, right and left bowers. 


# **Question 358**: should deal_one() allow the next to increment from next=23 to next=24? if I have an assertion that asserts whether the value of next is smaller than the PACK_SIZE. Or should I have an if-statement that examines whether the value of next is 23 or not?

**Answer**: There are 24 cards and we use 0-indexing. So the card at the 23rd index would be the "last" card. So you should be checking if going to the "next" card would exceed index 23.


# **Question 359**: Or the only case when there are no more cards left in the pack is when next equals to PACK_SIZE.  I assume the value of next can never be greater than PACK_SIZE right?

**Answer**: I believe next shouldn't be greater than PACK_SIZE. But to be safe, in case there's any bug in your code, it might be a good idea to include that as a fail safe.


# **Question 360**: Dear Instructors,  I am having issues implementing the overloaded card extraction operator in Card.cpp. I have code that I think should work, but fails the test_card_extraction test case in Card_public_tests.exe. My code reads in the rank from the stream directly into card.rank using the overloaded rank extraction operator provided, then reads " of " into a junk c++ string variable, but fails when I try to read the suit into card.suit using the overloaded suit extraction operator provided. (See image of code and exception below).   It appears that this issue arises due to the overloaded extraction operator for suit expecting the input to be all upper-case. (See image of operator below)  (1) Is this intended behavior for the overloaded suit extraction operator?  (2) If this is intended behavior for the overloaded suit extraction operator, how should I read in the suit from the in-stream? I can't assume that the suit is given in upper-case format and it seems strange to have to convert the input to upper-case before using the suit extraction operator.  Thank you,  Zachary Lin  Student implemented card extraction operator, instructor implemented suit extraction operator, suit extraction operator exception, instructor implemented rank extraction operator (in order):

**Answer**: It appears that this issue arises due to the overloaded extraction operator for suit expecting the input to be all upper-case.

Why do you make that assumption?


# **Question 361**: What is the purpose of implementing both operator <= and operator < ?  Won't they have the same implementation?  In what scenario would two cards be equal? Won't one card always be greater than or less than another card?  Same logic applies to operator >= and operator > . Won't they both have same implementation?  Also when would we use operator == ? 

**Answer**: If the same card is on both sides of the operator, then they would be equal.


# **Question 362**: Hi, I have a question for screw the dealer. Let us simulate a process for making the trump. We assume the upcard is a diamond.   First round, nobody has at least 2 face cards of diamond. Everybody pass. We go into the second round.  Second round, we decide hearts to be the possible trump. Everybody does not have at least one face card of the hearts. Then the second round passes too.  Then we invoke screw the dealer, the dealer must order up the suit that has the same color as the upcard which is the diamond. So the dealer still have to order up the hearts.   I do not think it makes sense to me. Can anyone fix the issues in this process?  

**Answer**: A round starts with the person on the dealer's left. So for screw the dealer, say it's second round and I'm the dealer. If the three people who go before me pass, then I would be forced to order up the suit that has the same color.




# **Question 363**: I just wanted to quickly ask about how to check for success for void functions like add_and_discard because the hands are private variables?  Thank you.

**Answer**: People sometimes test them by adding and discarding and then playing cards a bunch of times. You can combine functions to make tests like that.


# **Question 364**: Hi, I was wondering if I have the right logic for making trump for simple players in round 2.  I currently have a test case with this situation:  Upcard: King of Hearts  Simple player's hand: (Nine of Spades, Ace of Diamonds)  In my tests, I believe that this player will make trump in round 2 because they have the ace of diamonds. This runs correctly on my computer, however in the autograder it states that this player will not make trump.  I was wondering how I should go about fixing this situation, or where potential errors may be.  One last additional question was about if we have to implement HumanPlayer for this checkpoint, or if it will be due with the full project.  Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

**Answer**: Hi, 

I figured out what was going wrong with my autograder submission. I was still wondering if we are supposed to implement HumanPlayer for this checkpoint as it is still a bit unclear to me.


# **Question 365**: Hi,  I just want to make sure that I understand the game. I am not understanding why this test was marked as a false positive.  TEST(test_simple_player_play_card_left_bower_trump_card) {   Suit trump = CLUBS;   ASSERT_TRUE(trump == CLUBS);    Card led_card(NINE, CLUBS);    Player * bob = Player_factory("Bob", "Simple");   bob->add_card(Card(JACK, SPADES));   bob->add_card(Card(TEN, CLUBS));   bob->add_card(Card(KING, CLUBS));   bob->add_card(Card(QUEEN, CLUBS));   bob->add_card(Card(ACE, CLUBS)); // being played!!!    Card card_played = bob->play_card(led_card, trump);   cout << "Card played: " << card_played << endl;   // has to throw a club even though all trump   ASSERT_TRUE(card_played == Card(ACE, CLUBS));    delete bob; }  Thank you!

**Answer**: From the spec:

Left Bower: The Jack of the “same color” suit as trump is considered to be a trump (regardless of the suit printed on the card) and is the second most valuable card.


# **Question 366**: 

**Answer**: Marking this as completed since latest version on autograder shows this issue as having been resolved.


# **Question 367**: This part is not in my implementation. According to the comments, I cannot change this part.So how can I resolve this problem?  Besides, there's another problem.

**Answer**: Use the debugger to step through and you'll be able to see what went wrong.


# **Question 368**: Are we supposed to stick the dealer for the Human Player class make trump function? It doesn't say so in the spec, so are we supposed to assume that everything we did in SimplePlayer will be implemented in HumanPlayer?  

**Answer**: #414 - essentially, you should assume that the human player knows the rules of euchre and will play accordingly.


# **Question 369**: Yesterday, I asked a similar question as to why our Pack.cpp wasn't compiling properly. I made some changes, and uploaded it to the Autograder and got the points for Pack_Public_tests. Now, after making on changes to Pack.cpp, the Autograder is saying that it is failing one test but in my own terminal, it's not failing. Even when I run my debugger, it returns Nine of Spades and not the Jack of Spades which is what the Autograder is saying I'm returning. I made no changes to Pack.cpp that should dramatically affect these results.   Is it again an issue with not changing or initializing values that need to be intiialized that my computer automatically does for me and not the Autograder? I don't feel like it is, but I am curious as to why.  Thanks!

**Answer**: It looks like it still has to do with initializing member variables. Remember that when either constructor is invoked, every member variable has to be initialized. 


# **Question 370**: I have finished writing Player.cpp and the compiler shows no errors, but when I go to make the public player tests I get an error saying "expected type-specifier before ‘SimplePlayer’ " on the line where I am returning the pointer to the player. I am also getting errors saying "expected ‘;’ before ‘SimplePlayer’ " and " ‘SimplePlayer’ was not declared in this scope " on the same lines.   Any suggestions on how I can address this issue? I have left the code on the spec intact except for changing Simple to my class name, which is SimplePlayer, and I have made a 1-argument constructor that my compiler does seem to recognize.   Thank you in advance for your help.   

**Answer**: I managed to solve the issue! The problem was that I was defining the factory function before declaring the classes. 


# **Question 371**: For the making_trump function of SimplePlayer, in round 2 when we are checking the next suit, does the left bower count in this scenario? Say, for example, hearts are led, and I have the left bower. I know that it is technically a heart, but should I also allow it to factor in as a card of the same color for this function? Thank you!

**Answer**: I think I understand, but just to clarify-- the upcard was a heart, and you have the left bower, so the jack of diamonds. Everybody passed, so now it's on round two, and we're checking for diamonds. You're asking if you should consider the jack of diamonds a diamond in this case? if so-- yes! you should be including it in your count for both rounds.


# **Question 372**: Is it safe to assume that the dealer has at least one same color card as the trump card when screw the dealer is invoked?   Alternatively, if the dealer does not have at least one of the same color card as the trump card, is it safe to assume that at least one of the players (starting from the eldest to the one right before the dealer) has at least one same color card?   I thought that it would be problematic if the above is not the case because the dealer would be forced to order up when there aren't any same color cards in their hand

**Answer**: There's nothing wrong with ordering up a suit that you don't have in your hand-- it just means you're probably going to lose the round!


# **Question 373**: My group currently has full points on the autograder, but it says that we are failing "Student Player tests on student Player (UB Checks). We are not entirely sure what this means, or why we would have gotten it. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!  Furthermore, will we still get full points if we are unable to fix the issue before the deadline?

**Answer**: #28 #472


# **Question 374**: When we follow suit in playing a card, do we still care about the trump suit? e.g. if my led card is jack of spades and trump suit is clubs, is the suit I'm 'following' spades or clubs. And if it is spades, are all of my club cards still the most highly valued cards amongst the non-led-suit cards (ie nine clubs>ace diamonds)?  

**Answer**: If trump is clubs, then the jack of spades is considered a club, so you should lay a club to follow suit. 

Likewise, if spades was led, laying a jack of spades would not be following suit, because it is a club. However, yes, the club cards would still be the most highly valued cards, as in any club card > ace diamonds, AND any club card > spade, even if spades was led.

let me know if that was confusing!!


# **Question 375**: Here is one of my implementation. Is it okay to define vectors inside the class member function? It seems that the vectors are not being updated after the first time being called.

**Answer**: It's ok to define the vectors. I would need more information to determine what kind of error you are experiencing and how to debug it. Please come to OH for additional help!


# **Question 376**: Hello,  I am writing the test cases for play_card() and I am getting a false positive when running the test case below.  I just wanted to clarify what the expected play card should be for the case below: Even though there is a Jack of Spades in the hand and the lead card is the nine of Spades, the cards in the hand are all trumps, so the played card should be the highest trump (JACK of SPADES). Is this correct?  TEST(test_play_card_right_bower) {     Player * alice = Player_factory("Alice", "Simple");     Suit trump = CLUBS;     Card led_card(NINE, SPADES);      alice->add_card(Card(JACK, SPADES));     alice->add_card(Card(JACK, CLUBS));     alice->add_card(Card(ACE, CLUBS));      // Bob plays a card     Card card_played = alice->play_card(led_card, trump);     ASSERT_EQUAL(card_played, Card(JACK, SPADES));      delete alice; }   Thanks!

**Answer**: You are correct that all cards are trumps. So they need to play the highest trump card - the Jack of Clubs.


# **Question 377**: When returning name in the get_name() function name = "", not the player name. How can we create a player with the given name. 

**Answer**: I would make sure you have implemented ctor for the simple player that takes into account the name!


# **Question 378**: I am getting confused.  Spec: If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.  If you can't follow the lead suit, but have all trump cards, do you play your highest or lowest?  EX: For simple player playing card: if the trump is HEARTS and the leading card is SPADES, but you only have hearts, do you play the lowest or highest heart?

**Answer**: It's true that in a typical game of euchre you would want to play a trump card if you don't have any cards that follow suit. However, according to the spec, the simple player just plays the lowest card in their hand in this case. If they had all trump cards, they would play their lowest trump card.

They would play their lowest heart.


# **Question 379**: For deal_one(), what is next initially supposed to be. All of my tests are failing because this function is not working. For the first public test, my initialization is perfect but next is set at index 1 not 0, so it is returning the wrong value, and therefore the test is failing.   

**Answer 0**: i believe next is reset in the ctor so it is initially 0. and then in deal_one() the card at index 0 is returned first before index is incremented
**Answer 1**: Expanding on the student's answer:

Yes, next should be initialized as 0.

You don't need to "delete" the card that you deal. Every time you deal the next variable will be incremented, so you know the index of the card that needs to be dealt next. So even though the cards are technically still there, you can ignore the cards before "next" and assume they've been "removed" from the deck. 


# **Question 380**: hpp only says Does not consider trump. Then how about led card color? Thanks!

**Answer**: No need to consider those either. Just compare the value of the card assuming there are no trump or led suits.


# **Question 381**: The add_and_discard function will only get invoked when the dealer adds a card to his hand and discards the lowest in round1. Is that correct understanding?

**Answer**: i'm confused at your wording-- that's what the add_and_discard function does, but not when it is "invoked".

according to the spec, add_and_discard is invoked "If the trump suit is ordered up during round one".

is that helpful?

**Answer**: You forgot to delete Cynthia (line 116 in Player_tests.cpp). I would double check to make sure you are not forgetting to delete any Player objects anywhere else. 


# **Question 383**: For the input file format, can we assume that the cards will always be in the exact same order (starting with Nine of Spades and ending with Ace of Diamonds)? Or should we only assume that the file contains 24 different cards, but the order may be shuffled?

**Answer**: The latter.


# **Question 384**: Hi, my vscode says we pass all of the public test cases just fine, however when we put it into autograder, it says we fail the test case

**Answer**: Hi, this is unfortunately difficult to debug when we can't run your code on your machine and check what the debugger prints out. Please come to OH for help!


# **Question 385**: Should we make a CARD_NAMES just like rank and suit have RANK_NAMES and SUIT_NAMES?  Also, for the std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &is, Card &card)function, should we make a string_to_card helper function just like suit and rank have string_to_suit and string_to_rank?  

**Answer**: I don't think having a enum for CARD_NAMES will be very helpful since the value of the card will change based on the trump/lead suits. 
You are free to create helper functions. 


# **Question 386**: we keep getting these errors in autograder even though all functions are called in Player.hpp and we've included it in Player.cpp. any ideas why its doing this?  

**Answer**: Make sure you don't change Player.hpp (since you dont submit that, autograder will use the version provided with the starter files). All new class and function declarations must be in Player.cpp.


# **Question 387**: Let's say that the led suit is diamonds and the trump is diamonds. If you have no diamond cards in your hand and you only have the left bower, does this count as being a part of the led suit? Is the left bower considered a diamond here? 

**Answer**: By definition, the left bower would be a diamond


# **Question 388**: "If any player orders up, the upcard’s suit becomes trump and the dealer is given the option to replace one of their cards with the upcard". For simple player, when does the dealer decide to do this, and what card do they substitute the upcard for? Please let me know if there is a place where this logic is spelled out. I just couldn't find it in the rule explanation or the spec. Thank you!

**Answer**: It's in Player-Simple Player-Making section


# **Question 389**: Hi! When I tried to write test cases for simple player play_card function with 1) all cards available are aligned with the led card's suit 2) not all cards are aligned with the led card's suit but the same suit card is available in hand, I got both tests as false positives. I am not sure what is wrong (with my implementation in Player.cpp or the test cases itself), and wonder if anyone can give me some hints on the issue. Thank you!

**Answer**: False positives mean that your test incorrectly identifies correct code as incorrect. I.e. when we run your tests again our solution, they return that the solution is incorrect. 

I took a look at your false positive tests and they seem to assume the player will be playing the lowest card in their hand when you can follow led suit, and the highest when they cannot. 

The spec notes "If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand." This seems to be the issue in both tests. Let me know if this helps!


# **Question 390**: For the representation invariants section, is it asking us to make a function for check invariants, which asserts that the cards are ordered using comparisons, like in the lecture notes with triangle, or is it just asking us to call the sort method on the hand each time we add a card?

**Answer**: It is just asking you to call sort every time a card is added to the hand. 


# **Question 391**: I'm having trouble passing the Card test. Everytime I submitted to Autograder it show "  bash: line 1: ./Card_public_tests.exe: No such file or directory" and the compiler would say  /usr/bin/ld: Card_public_tests.o: in function `test_card_insertion()': /home/autograder/working_dir/Card_public_tests.cpp:53:(.text+0x4e5): undefined reference to `operator<<(std::ostream&, Card const&)' /usr/bin/ld: Card_public_tests.o: in function `test_card_extraction()': /home/autograder/working_dir/Card_public_tests.cpp:60:(.text+0x65e): undefined reference to `operator>>(std::istream&, Card&)' /usr/bin/ld: Card_public_tests.o: in function `decltype ({parm#1}<<{parm#2})& unit_test_framework::Diagnostic::print_helper<Card>(std::ostream&, Card const&, int, int)': /home/autograder/working_dir/unit_test_framework.hpp:215:(.text._ZN19unit_test_framework10Diagnostic12print_helperI4CardEERDTlsfp_fp0_ERSoRKT_ii[_ZN19unit_test_framework10Diagnostic12print_helperI4CardEERDTlsfp_fp0_ERSoRKT_ii]+0x29): undefined reference to `operator<<(std::ostream&, Card const&)' collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status make: *** [public.mk:32: Card_public_tests.exe] Error 1   

**Answer**: The error is indicating that your Card_public_tests did not compile as a result of a missing definition for operator<< and operator>>. Make sure you implemented these correctly in Card.cpp.


# **Question 392**: I have the following as my class constructor, yet when Bob is constructed he remains an object of the base class. How do I correct this?  P.S. When running, the first test case run is for get_name, which passes despite not converting the base class to Simple. So somehow it was able to find an implementation for get_name() without assigning Alice to Simple Player.

**Answer**: Can you show me your Player_factory function?


# **Question 393**: When implementing the default constructor for Pack , is it okay to initialize the cards array in the body of the constructor (i.e. inside the curly braces)? Here's what I have:  Pack::Pack()    : next(0) {   int index = 0;   for (int s = SPADES; s <= DIAMONDS; ++s) {     for (int r = NINE; r <= ACE; ++r) {       cards[index] = Card(static_cast<Rank>(r), static_cast<Suit>(s));       ++index;     }   } }   I'm asking because I remember hearing in lecture that it's generally not a good idea to do this and that it's always better to use a member-initializer list instead.  If this is not good practice, then could I get some guidance on what I can do instead? I don't remember learning about how to initialize an array in the member-initializer list.

**Answer**: Yes, it's okay to initialize the cards array using the curly braces.

 It's not a good idea to initialize member variables outside of a member-initializer list due to efficiency. With a member-initialized list, the constructor initializes the variable with the value given. However, if the variable is not initialized through the list, the constructor initializes the variable with a default value and then assigns the value in the curly braces.

However, there are some cases where it's necessary to use the curly braces :)




# **Question 394**: Autograder says this: Simple Player add_and_discard() Bug #2 - Your tests fail to catch a bug in this function.  Need some guidance on add_and_discard test cases. This function is called only if  in round 1 a player orders up and an upcard becomes a trump. The dealer then has the option to replace one of their cards  The add_and_discard function is called for this purpose.  This function returns void. How can we test that the dealer added/discarded the correct card?  Do we check all cards in dealers hand before and after add_and_discard? There is no public function to get the vector<Card> hand?

**Answer**: The way I did it was play out the hand after the add/discard was done. If the hand is as expected, you can follow the rules set out in the spec on how the hand should be played out and assert equal each card in the test. This is a good way to implicitly test your play_card function as well.


# **Question 395**: My question asks if we can treat left bowers of trump suits the same with led suits. For example, if the trump suit and led suit is different, lets say trump is hearts and led suit is spades. If we have a left bower of the spade suit, then does that mean we can follow suit? Or do bowers only apply to trump?

**Answer**: bowers only apply to trump ^^


# **Question 396**: I know we have to make the SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer derived classes and define the member functions in the derived classes.  Do we still have to define the functions in the base class then? Can we just leave them as function stubs?  It seems kind of redundant to give the same definition of a function between the derived classes and the base class.  

**Answer**: the base class is already written for you, you can find it Player.hpp!

"It seems kind of redundant to give the same definition of a function between the derived classes and the base class." that's exactly why pure virtual functions exist! you'll notice that in Player.hpp, all of the functions are virtual and end in "= 0". "virtual" defines it as a function that can be overridden, and the "= 0" is what makes it "pure"-- meaning it must be overridden in order to be used because there is no base class implementation.


# **Question 397**: I have two related questions about the led suit and the left bower:  1. When implementing bool Card_less(const Card &a, const Card &b, const Card &led_card, Suit trump) in Card.cpp, if the left bower is the led_card, is the led suit the original suit of the led_card or is it the trump suit?  In other words, which one of these two lines would be correct?  Suit led = led_card.get_suit(trump);   Suit led = led_card.get_suit();   2. When implementing play_card(const Card &led_card, Suit trump) in Player.cpp, if the left bower is the led_card, is the led suit the original suit of the led_card or is it the trump suit?

**Answer**: 1. Suit led = led_card.get_suit(trump); 

2. Trump suit

Remember that once the trump is made, the left bower "adopts" that suit and is always considered part of the trump suit for the remainder of the hand.


# **Question 398**: For the checkpoint submission, is it sufficient to only implement the human subtype to the extent necessary to pass the tests in Player_public_tests.cpp?  Or do we need to fully implement human and write our own tests of human in Player_tests.cpp at this time?

**Answer**: There are no private tests for the checkpoint, if that is what you mean! So if you are passing everything up through the player public tests, then you should be good checkpoint-wise.


# **Question 399**: I'm still confused on the spec. It says "The dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand, even if this is the upcard, for a final total of five cards. (Note that at this point, the trump suit is the suit of the upcard.)", then should I consider trump suit (suit of the upcard) when choosing the lowest card?   For example,   1. If I have 4 trump cards and 1 non-trump card in hand, then, should I always keep the upcard and discard the the one non-trump card?  3. If I have 5 trump cards in hand, then should I discard the lowest trump card while considering the trump suit values (right bower > left bower > A > K > Q > 10 > 9) ?  

**Answer**: Yep, you are exactly correct. You'll discard your lowest card in relation to the trump suit, so your examples are accurate.


# **Question 400**: In my current implementation for humanplayer tests I am using play_card to read the players hand in the tests. For such functions such as add_and_discard I use input redirection to get a certain input to read the first card for every play_card. How will the autograder test my tests if it doesnt know what inputs it should have? I keep getting false positives.   

**Answer**: You don't need to test human players!

We will autograde your Card_tests.cpp and Player_tests.cpp unit tests. Note that your player tests should only test the “simple player”, not the “human player”.




# **Question 401**: Hi! I'm a bit confused about setting names for the Simple and Human player. Currently when running the public_tests it asks for a name input in the player insertion but I didn't think we needed to provide a name for it. Is it running Human instead?  The error says that.   

**Answer**: Make sure you have a constructor for both Simple and Human players to take name as an input and set it to the player's name. You are getting this error because this constructor is not working correctly. 


# **Question 402**: If we submit more than 3 times a day to autograder, and our last submission is the highest, will it still count as a submission? Is the 3 submissions rule only for providing hints?    Thank you!

**Answer**: You are only able to submit up to 3 times a day to autograder. The submission with the highest points will be counted as your final submission. 


# **Question 403**: Will the Autograder allow me to submit files to the Project 3 Checkpoint after the due date? I know that it won't count towards my final grade, but will it still score my submission like it would if I had submitted it on time?

**Answer**: It will not let you submit if you're used 3 or it's past the due date


# **Question 404**: The autograder said I have a false positive for a test function that tests the card_less function that takes into account trump, and I'm not really sure whether the issue is with the way I wrote my tests or if it is the actual implementation in card.cpp. If anyone could give any hints on what the issue is, that would be much appreciated. Thank you!

**Answer**: One of the test cases in test_card_card_less_trump is asserting that a trump card is higher (not less) than the left bower.


# **Question 405**: Since the overloaded operators for cards like < and > don't consider trump, and thus don't consider bowers, how can we accurately determine which cards are highest and lowest in functions like lead_card and play_card in Player.cpp? Should we add extra code each time to properly rank the cards?

**Answer**: Think about some other functions you have implemented in Card.cpp that you could use. Are there any functions that take in two cards, a trump suit, and even a led suit and determine if one card is less than the other? How can you use those functions to find, for instance, the "max" or "min" card in one's hand to play in a trick?




# **Question 406**: We have been trying to write test functions for a while, we have several false positives. I do not know if this is because of the implementation or tests. Please help us on both the false positive errors, and the missing test function bugs.

**Answer**: The false positive means for that test you said the result should be true and it did return true, but it should actually be false. So for example maybe on the play function you said ASSERT_EQUAL(play(), and CARD(JACK, KING)) and it returned true, but the test should've actually returned false as that shouldn't have been played.




# **Question 407**: When will the autograder open for the full project? I wan trying to submit it but there was only tabs for the checkpoint. 

**Answer**: I believe it's open now


# **Question 408**: Hi,  I submitted my work before the deadline and received full points, but I encountered UB errors. I'd like to check if I've resolved them. However, I haven't started writing the euchre section yet, so I don't think I should submit the full project just yet. Is it okay to submit to the checkpoint even though it's after the deadline? If I do, will it affect the score I already have?  Thanks in advance for your help!

**Answer**: I believe you can't submit to the checkpoint anymore, however the full project 3 autograder also has all of the tests from the checkpoint. So, you can just submit to that, it's fine that you haven't written the euchre section yet.


# **Question 409**: I have these two testcases for the player class, however in the autograder it said they have false positives. But I think the result in the assert are correct ones according to my understanding to the spec. Can you have a look and see what should be the correct result for these cases?

**Answer**: According to the spec: If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.

Remember that the left bower (jack of the same color suit as the trump suit) counts as the trump suit. In your first test case the Ace of Spades is led with spades being trump. Therefore the Jack of Clubs is following suit because it is the left bower and in this case a spade. It is a similar issue in the second test case.

Lastly, remember to make your post private any time you share code. I have set your post to private but please remember to do so yourself in the future.


# **Question 410**: Will Ed Discussion be active during spring break? If so, can I expect responses?

**Answer**: The forum will be active, but staff may not be answering as many questions over break.


# **Question 411**: Hello, what am I doing wrong with my inclusion statements in euchre.cpp for the other hpp files?  

**Answer**: Nothing. VSCode will often give error squiggles around include statements if it cannot find them, but note that VSCode and the compiler are not the same. If you try compiling - barring any other errors - it will be fine. If the error squiggles really do bug you, you may need to select G++ as the compiler. Here's a starting point: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/configure-intellisense


# **Question 412**: for euchre.cpp, do we have to create a header file for the class?  

**Answer**: No, you do not need to make a header file for euchre.cpp.


# **Question 413**: Hello,  My partner and I are facing an issue where we are failing the test case where the player has to lead with no trump in their hand. Given the cards in her hand and knowing it is a simple player, we would expect them to play the Ace of Hearts. Instead, they are playing a 2 of spades, our default card. We found that it is because when we call card_less, it finds that the 2 is trump and is, therefore, higher. To prevent it from reaching that point in the function, we wrote the if statement at the top to check if the card we are checking against is a two because any other valid euchre card should be greater than it, regardless of trump. However, in the debugger, it seems to pass over this line as though the cases are not met which based on the variables I think they are. Is there a better way to do this?

**Answer**: If the program is "skipping" over code without running it, your executable may be out of date. Try making it again. Which "if statement at the top" are you referring to? I might be able to give some more information then.

# **Question 417**: I'm running test01. In Hand 1, my cards aren't being dealt correctly even though they were correct in Hand 0 and I made sure to reset the pack before shuffling in my shuffle function. The cards in question are Ace of Clubs and Jack of Diamonds. The Ace of Clubs is supposed to go to the player at index 2(Gabriel) and the Jack of Diamonds is supposed to go to the player at index 3(Herb). For some reason, the Jack of Diamonds is given to Gabriel so when it's time for Gabriel to take the Ace of Clubs, he can't because he already has 5 cards.  This is my code for the deal function, I would really appreciate any help or insight you can provide me with.

**Answer 0**: You shouldn't be creating a new pack every time you shuffle. Instead call shuffle on the existing pack.
**Answer 1**: I found the issue, thank you.




# **Question 418**: Hi! So we read someone else's thread about testing the add_and_discard function in SimplePlayer, and we were also having trouble with it (#513). Someone replied to it saying that they played out the entire hand after they had called the add_and_discard function in the test case, and asserting equal each card in the test. However, in the past we made a public vector for the cards in our hand and the compiler did not allow us to assert equal each card. We were wondering if there is another way to make the vector accessible to the tests or if there is another way to test this function. Thanks!

**Answer**: To test this function, you can use add_card to add cards to a players hand, then call add_and_discard. Then, you can use lead_card or play_card repeatedly to see whether the card you expected to be discarded remained in the hand or not.


# **Question 419**: Hello!  I would like to be able to print out all the cards in a player's hand as a function in euchre.cpp for debugging purposes, but I am not sure how to do this since hand is a private part of a Player. Am I allowed to make a function in Simple Player that prints the hand? Or are we not supposed to modify the structure of Player?  

**Answer**: If you are trying to debug, it is best to use the visual debugger as it will show you the member variables as you debug. As far as modifying the simple player, it will likely cause problems as all functions in Player.hpp are pure virtual.


# **Question 420**: Is our program supposed to account for multiple rounds (hands)? For instance, after all 5 tricks are played, am I supposed to restart the hand by shuffling, dealing... Also, when hand ends, does the dealer become the person to the left of the previous dealer?  

**Answer**: Yes and yes.


# **Question 421**: For the different hands, how does the upcard change? Am I supposed to shuffle the deck again after the first hand?

**Answer**: Yes, the deck should be shuffled at the beginning of each hand.


# **Question 422**: Hi, I'm confused about add_card and add_and_discard for the simple player.   The spec says: "If the trump suit is ordered up during round one, the dealer picks up the upcard. The dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand, even if this is the upcard, for a final total of five cards. (Note that at this point, the trump suit is the suit of the upcard.)"  During making trump, all players have five cards. If the simple player is the dealer, they pick up the upcard before discarding the lowest card in their hand. This breaks the requires clause for add_card.   Also the requires clause for add_and_discard only requires player has at least one card. It seems that the only time a player may add and discard a card is during making trump--when all players have 5 cards, am i missing something? Thanks

**Answer**: Note that you are adding and discarding in add_and_discard so you can discard before you add to meet the requires clause of add_card. Additionally, you are correct that add_and_discard will practically only be used when a player has 5 cards, but the function should be implemented such that it would work as long as the player has at least one card.


# **Question 423**: Hi,   When "screw the dealer" happens in the second round, will the human player be provided with a chance to enter their choices? Or the game will automatically decide for them, which is ordering up.

**Answer**: The human player is still given the chance to enter their choices. We "trust" that the human player plays according to the rules.


# **Question 424**: Are you supposed to take the discarded cards and put them in a specific order and then shuffle? Or do you start from the same pack.in order when shuffling before the start of the next hand? How would the upcard change for each hand?

**Answer**: Remember that when we deal cards from the pack, all we're really doing is moving our "next" around. So, you can just use your normal shuffle implementation each time on the pack. You don't want to start from the same pack.in order each time.


# **Question 425**: When a game is created, can we assume all players be the same type (all human or all simple)? Or can there be a mix of human and simple players?

**Answer**: There can be a mix. When writing Euchre.cpp, you shouldn't need to account for whether a player is human or simple once the player object has been made since the two classes have matching function calls.


# **Question 426**: Hi,   I just wanted to double check my understanding of the operators. I know you are supposed to account for both the rank and suit, but are you only supposed to look at suit when ranks are equal? Or are both suit and rank determining order for all cards? For example, my < operator ranks the Queen of Diamonds higher than the Ace of Clubs when asked to evaluate Ace < Queen because diamonds rank higher than clubs. Should this be the case? or should I write the code to evaluate suit only if ranks are equal?   Thanks!   

**Answer**: Take a look at the value of cards section of the spec. You only look at suit when ranks are equal.


# **Question 427**: I am trying to debug for the human players' test, but I am not sure how to set up standard input in Xcode (< euchre_test50.in > euchre_test50.out). It seems like there isn't an option to do so.

**Answer**: There's a tutorial section about this.


# **Question 428**: Hi, I have a question when using ASSERT_EQUAL() when testing player.cpp. Does that assert only compare rank? I got some false positives on my test cases for player.cpp, and when I looked into it, ASSERT_EQUAL() was basically saying my card was two suits at the same time.   For example, from the Player_public_tests.cpp in test_simple_player_lead_card:  ASSERT_EQUAL(card_led, ace_spades); equates to true when card_led = Card(ACE, SPADES) and ace_spades = Card(ACE, SPADES)  but  ASSERT_EQUAL(card_led, ace_diamonds); also equates to true when card_led = Card(ACE, SPADES) but ace_diamonds = Card(ACE, DIAMONDS)  If I changed the rank and said ASSERT_EQUAL(card_led, ten_spades) when card_led = Card(ACE, SPADES) then I end up with a false. From my perspective, it seems like ASSERT_EQUAL() only compares rank. Is this correct thinking or did I download something incorrectly? Would it have something to do with GitHub?

**Answer**: This is most likely an issue with how you implemented operator== in Card.cpp. Make sure that function takes into account both rank and suit.


# **Question 429**: I've tried a couple different things and all of them come up as wrong. When trying to access the players inside std::vector<Player*> players; nothing seems to work. I've tried *players[index], players[index], and  &players[index] and all of them come up with an error.  On top of that if I try to put it into a Player first, it says "object of abstract class type "Player" is not allowed" even though I have #include "Player.hpp"   Please help point me in the right direction!

**Answer**: You should be able to use the players using, for example, Player* player = players[index], or players[index]->some_function() . If that's not working, follow up here.


# **Question 430**: For euchre_tests01, why is the second card turned up different than the first one if the shuffling is the same both times? Am i missing something from the spec where it specifies something?    

**Answer**: You aren't shuffling a "fresh" pack each time. For example, on the second hand, you'll be shuffling the shuffled deck, resulting in a new arrangement of cards.


# **Question 431**: For euchre_tests01, for the second hand, do you just shuffle the deck again, even if it was already shuffled before? In that case, you don't need to create a separate vector to store the cards that were played and shuffle them specifically, right? So, it’s not about shuffling the cards in the order they were played. How does this process differ from the way a human would handle it?

**Answer**: If you call your shuffle function again, and it is written correctly, you shouldn't have any issues. You don't need to save played cards or anything like that.


# **Question 432**: This is a testcase I made for testing my comparator operators for the cards. Autograder is telling me I have a false positive here, but as far as I checked, these should all be true. Can anyone see the error here? 

**Answer**: I think its because you have QS < JD which implies queen is less than jack, which isn't true since according to the spec "In the simplest case, cards are ordered by rank (A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9), with ties broken by suit (D > C > H > S)."




# **Question 433**: For euchre_test01, on my machine, the output is:  The last line is "Fran and Herb win!"  However, on the autograder, the last line did not print  The rest all match.  I noticed there are memory leaks, as indicated by the autograder. Would that be the reason?

**Answer**: Yes, memory leak might be the reason. I suggest you look at the error output on AG about memory leak as it gives you the line number of where leaking happens. You can also setup the leak checking flag by following this tutorial to check memory leak locally. 




# **Question 434**: How is it my code compiles in vs code but can't in autograder? 

**Answer**: There might be many reasons. The general approach is to look at the error message on AG and debug from there. You can also check out this tutorial to push your code to caen and run it there. 

In your case, please double check you have submitted all required files to AG.




# **Question 435**: I understand that to test the euchre.cpp driver implementations ,it's recommended to see how our "outfile" compares to that of the correct answer. For some reason, our file is completely blank. How should we go about tackling this issue? 

**Answer**: Could you send the command line prompt you used to generate the outfile? 

./euchre.exe [bunch of args] > [your outfile] works for me.


# **Question 436**: When running euchre.cpp there is nothing outputted to euchre_test00.out. What command line argument should the output file be assigned to? 

**Answer**: Please take a look at the protip here




# **Question 437**: I keep getting the error in the title when I try to run the Player public tests. I used the debugger to find out the error is created when running the last line of test_simple_player_play_card. (Line 118 in the screenshot below).  Since this line is "delete bob", I suspected there might be a problem with the destructor. However, I have not modified the destructor in Player.hpp and I also have not written a destructor in the derived Player classes.  I have also not modified the Player public tests in any way.  I read online it could be because the pointer was getting overwritten, but in the debugging window, the bob player pointer does not change at all.  Can someone help me figure out what this error means and how to fix it?  The section of code from Player_public_tests.cpp (highlighted line 118):    

**Answer 0**: It's hard to figure this out without taking a deeper look at the code. A few things to check: make sure you're updated code is compiled and the debugger is running the most current version of the code, make sure there is no destructor for player other than the empty destructor provided in Player.hpp.
**Answer 1**: I found the problem. I was trying to erase from a negative index, which caused memory corruption on the player pointer. The corrupted player pointer "bob" was then unable to be deleted in the last line of the test.


# **Question 438**: In the player_public_tests, lead_card fails to pass the test which I believe is due to my lead_card function. Ive implemented it to return a card that matches the suit of the trump regardless of all other cards just like the spec says. I get the output of Nine of hearts != Ace of spades.   My question is why would I output a Ace of spades if in my deck, I have a card with the trump suit. Am i supposed to output a card depending on the Rank or the suit of the card?  for example, if I have a left bower or right bower of a suit, would I return those cards regardless if theres a higher ranking card in the deck or still return the highest ranking card?

**Answer**: "When a Simple Player leads a trick, they play the highest non-trump card in their hand". For lead card, you play highest non_trump card first. It is only in the case where ALL cards in your hand are trump that you play the highest trump.


# **Question 439**: Simple Player and Human player have very similar functions, with the get_name and add_card implementations being identical. The autograder says the code for these functions is duplicated but they can't really be moved out of player.cpp. How can I fix this issue so these two functions are not duplicated but still member functions of the simple and human player classes?

**Answer**: Make sure you are reading the spec very carefully, because the implementations aren't super similar for the Simple and Human players, the Simple player will be more complex and have to make decisions where the human player side only has to provide choices and receive in a decision of what to do from the human player, along with that, in the spec you are provided with a lot of code that you can use to implement your human player functions.

Check this part of the spec: https://eecs280staff.github.io/euchre/#human-player


# **Question 440**: So im currently playing a quick game of euchre where I had a trump suit being spades. A player initially placed Ace of clubs, 10 of spades and 9 of hearts. why is the game only letting me choose two cards of my deck which are queen of clubs and 10 of clubs where I also had a queen of spades but it did not give me the option to choose it.  I'd like to understand how I could connect this with the lead_card function. From my understanding the simple_player is supposed to choose the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand. Im a bit confused on how to keep moving forward.  

**Answer**: If the led card was an Ace of Clubs, you have to follow suit with what was led, and that is a general rule of euchre, you must follow the suit of what was led if possible, and since you had 2 clubs cards in your deck, you must follow suit by playing a club. If instead you had a queen of hearts, a 10 of diamonds, and a queen of spades, then you wouldn't have any cards that follow the suit of the led card and would be allowed to play any card in your hand. In the case of the other players playing cards not of the led suit, they just didn't have cards that matched the led card suit.


# **Question 441**: Hi,  My code compiles and passes all the "Euchre Public Tests with Solution Card, Pack, Player" including the Test00, Test01, and Test50 output, but does not pass the UB checks for all of those. What could be going wrong?

**Answer**: Note that you can click on the tests themselves to see what the output is. I'd also recommend making sure to enable address sanitizers when running the tests locally.




# **Question 442**: Hi! Since we wrote a default constructor for Pack, will we ever need to call it in euchre.cpp? Or will there always be an input pack and thus only the second constructor will be called? Thanks!

**Answer**: You shouldn't need to call the default constructor in euchre.cpp


# **Question 443**: I am working on keeping track of points for player teams on euchre.cpp  I am having a hard time keeping track of which player played the card that wins the trick (so that they win the trick and points are added to their team)  I have tried having a vector that includes the card and player who played it and I have tried creating two separate vectors with one containing the cards played in a trick, and the other containing players. But it does not allow me to use push_back on a vector of players, as no overload function exists to accommodate that. May I please have some guidance on how I can go about this?  Thank you.

**Answer**: I think the creating 2 separate vectors is a good strategy especially since you already explored that idea. I'd be careful using push_back any time other than when you might be initializing a vector for use since push_back will increase the size of your vector and make it hard to align which card belongs to which player and this may be where you were having issues, and you might want to try just indexing instead. Remember that you can also using indexing to change the value at a specified position in the vector such as overwriting an already existing value. Also if you have 2 vectors of size 4 to hold both the players and the cards in the hand and have to go through the players around the table, you can figure out a way to keep track between the two vectors of which player played which card.


# **Question 444**: Hi,   The autograder says there's code duplication in Card.cpp. Can I define a helper function in card.cpp to avoid this?

**Answer**: If this is in the different version of Card_less, I would recommend seeing if you can call some versions of Card_less in the other functions to reduce code duplication.


# **Question 445**: Is play_hand just for when we go through the 5 tricks, or are we supposed to consider more than just the 5 tricks? Or are we thinking of it differently and we need to consider something for play_hand? My partner and I are having issues when considering what play_hand does.   

**Answer**: You are free to organize the code how you'd like, but you can have play_hand take care of shuffling, dealing, making trump, and playing the 5 tricks.


# **Question 446**: Hi!  I created a Game class, as suggested, and created a shuffle function, also as suggested, which shuffles the pack if and only if a boolean value "is_shuffling" is true.   However, the IF statement always skips, even if the debugger says the value is true immediately before the IF statement. So my code never shuffles :(  I confirmed that the bool is accessible.  Why might the IF statement be skipped anyway?  

**Answer**: Answer: It had to do with the way shuffle was initialized. Fixed!


# **Question 447**: Hello,  When I am running test01 in the autograder, Gabriel plays Nine of Clubs instead of Jack of Diamonds, which I know he has in his hand because he plays it later in the hand of the correct output. According to the specifications, aren't the simple players supposed to play the highest card of the led suit, in this case Diamonds? Thank you for your help and clarification.  

**Answer**: The Jack of Diamonds is the left bower so it is considered a Heart, not Diamond. Note that for test01, there's a full explanation available here.


# **Question 448**: Hi, we were working on euchre.cpp and when making euchre.exe in the terminal there was a bunch of errors related to the fact that Players has two derived classes. It mentioned something about "virtual functions" and "uninitialized copies".  For example, it said: "Player.hpp:17:7: note: because the following virtual functions are pure within ‘Player’: 17 | class Player { | ^~~~~~"  We are thinking this may have to do with the fact that we have a vector of players, with each element of type * from the Player Factory (so basically a virtual vector), or maybe it has to do with the derived classes?  We really want all players to be in their assigned index in a vector of size 4 (just for ease of not needing to specify the type in the Game functions), but unfortunately this error has come up. Any help is appreciated!

**Answer**: If you have a vector defined as vector<Player*> and are using the Player_factory to fill it, that shouldn't cause issues so the problem may be elsewhere. Make sure you are overriding all the functions you need to. If you are still having issues, you can create a private post with your code or come to office hours once they start back up.


# **Question 449**: For euchre_test00 my output looks to be the same as autograder except I'm still not getting the point and this one line is highlighted. How do I fix this issue  

**Answer**: This is a whitespace issue. If you click on "show whitespace" at the bottom of the output, it should show you what the issue is. In this case, I believe you have an extra space at the end of the line.


# **Question 450**: For the test "test_simple_player_lead_card", I'm passing in vscode but failing in the autograder. the result should be the ace of spades which is what I get in vscode, but the autograder is saying that my code is outputting the king of spades. what could be the reason for the conflicting results?

**Answer**: Hmmm, that is odd--I would expect local and Autograder tests to output the same.  Double check that your local version of  Player.cpp matches the code uploaded to autograder. Otherwise, I would guess that something is going wrong with how you are accessing things in memory (i.e. adding or removing things from your collection of cards). 




# **Question 451**: In the Game class in the Euchre.cpp, do we have to account for the fact that the dealer is not always player 0 and that it rotates to the left each round. This would impact which players get what number of cards following the 3-2-3-2 and 2-3-2-3 rule.

**Answer**: Yes, you do have to account for that when implementing your driver function.




# **Question 452**: Keep getting this error on Player public tests. Need some guidance.

**Answer**: "test_add_and_discard": FAIL18In ASSERT_EQUAL(hand2, expected2), line 459:19{ Ten of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, Ace of Diamonds } != { Nine of Hearts, Ten of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts }: This line most likely means your add_and_discard function might be doing something wrong. It is discarding nine of hearts instead of ace of diamonds. I would check your add and discard function and double check your operator functions in card as well to make sure they compare correctly.


# **Question 453**: Hi, I am getting a code duplication error for my card_less functions. They are very similar in nature so some parts of their definitions are similar as well. Any help would be appreciated please.

**Answer**: You can call some of your card_less functions in other ones. This may help with the code duplication issues.


# **Question 454**: Hello, I keep getting false positives for my play_card tests and do not really know what to do. I used play card tests in other parts of my tests and it worked fine but in play tests it keeps reporting a false positive. I am not sure what is wrong and was wondering if anyone could give me any hints on the issue. Thank you.

**Answer**: Take a look at what you are asserting and what is actually being returned to make sure that you are not asserting the wrong card for any of the asserts. 


# **Question 455**: Hi!  I noticed that Autograder have "Euchre Private Tests" and "Euchre Private Tests with Solution Card, Pack, Player" sections. Since we are not required to make private tests cpp file for euchre.cpp. So I am wondering how we can check whether all the private tests for euchre are satisfied or not.  

**Answer**: One way to do this is to write your own output solution for a specific set of command line arguments, and then run your solution with those to see if your program output matches the solution you created.


# **Question 456**: I'm confused on the given "euchre_test50.out.correct" file. I think there's should be an extra newline between line 186 and line 187. Am I correct? 

**Answer**: For that instance, it is still the first round of making trump, so that means the dealer has to discard one of their cards, and that is what is happening in this case, and the file is correct. Since it is still a part of making trump there won't be a new line space between that and the discard, and instead the new line is after the discard before the first trick and after making trump is complete.


# **Question 457**: When implementing the Game ADT, are we allowed to make a Game.hpp file and Game.cpp file? If so, should I submit both of the hpp file and the cpp file to the autograder?

**Answer**: No, it should all be implemented in euchre.cpp as the autograder only takes that file for grading. 


# **Question 458**: When implementing the make_trump() function in euchre.cpp what should the initial upcard be. How do we keep track of the upcards since they are not in a player's hand?

**Answer**: The upcard should be the first card from the pack, i.e., the result when you call deal_one on the pack


# **Question 459**: In euchre.cpp, the spec suggests we include void shuffle() as a private member function, but we have already written void shuffle() in Pack.cpp. I'm just a little confused on whether we are supposed to copy and paste our shuffle() from Pack.cpp into euchre.cpp, or if there is some sort of inheritance I need to make sure it calls the shuffle() function I already wrote. 

**Answer**: The shuffle() function in Pack actually shuffles the deck of cards, you shouldn't rewrite this or re-declare it in euchre.cpp. The suggestion is to have a function in euchre.cpp that reads the input and determines what to do with the pack of cards, possibly calling the pack.cpp shuffle() function or not depending on the game inputs. 




# **Question 460**: Hi, we asked a question about using Player vector in thread #581 yesterday, and we had some follow up questions!  Our vector is currently type Player, and we just assigned each value of the vector to *Playerfactory(name, strategy). This works for calling the player vector like players[index].get_name() with no errors except for the terminal telling us that the calls to the vector have unitialized copies, like below.  Vector of type Player:  for example, here is a call to the vector (no errors)  Error messages:    If we do change it to a vector of type Player*, we would have issues with accessing the players. For instance, when we tried dereferencing it with *players[index].get_name() or even *(players[index].get_name()) it still gave us an error (shown below). How could we eliminate this error?  Vector of type Player*:  And now each of the calls to the vector has the error: "expression must have class type but it has type "__gnu_cxx::__alloc_traits<std::allocator<Player *>, std::allocator<Player *>::value_type>::value_type" (aka "Player *")". How could we correctly dereference these calls to the vector?  And then it wouldn't let us make the euchre.exe file in the terminal of course, because of these red underlined errors.  Let us know if you are able to help!

**Answer**: Try using a vector<Player*> players, and then accessing functions like players[0]->get_name . This makes it so that you are dereferencing the Player*, and not the vector which is what I suspect is happening in your last code snippet. *(players[0].get_name())  tries to dereference the name, not the Player*.


# **Question 461**: This is the command used to generate the result: ./euchre.exe pack.in shuffle 10 Edsger Simple Fran Simple Gabriel Simple Herb Simple   This is the expected output of euchre_test01  In the line 19, Edsger led a King of Diamonds and Gabriel played a Nine of Spades. However at line 32, Gabriel played a Jack of Diamonds. This means that at the trick when Edsger led a King of Diamonds, he is supposed to play Jack of Diamonds because in the project spec it specifically said: "If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand."  Gabriel played a card that does not follow suit of Diamond at line 21 when he does have a card in the suit of diamond.  Did I misunderstood the project spec? Please correct me if I'm wrong. Thank you very much!

**Answer**: The Jack of Diamonds is the left bower so it is considered a Heart, not Diamond. Note that for test01, there's a full explanation available here.


# **Question 462**: Hi,   I am confused on how to set up the input redirection to get the debugger set up to run the human player. I read the spec and linked guide but I am confused on what I am supposed to modify in the json file.   This is currently what I have. I am not sure exactly what belongs in the  "args" column to make the input redirection work. I am running VS code (w/ WSL) on windows.   

**Answer 0**: #471 's response didn't work for me, but it might work for you since you're on windows!
**Answer 1**: 

All you need to do is just add extra arguments at the very end of your args in debugger with the remaining arguments rather than at the front where you have them now just like similar to the above provided command line, however without the > euchre_test50.out at the end since you need to follow that same format/style.

So in your case your args would be "pack.in", "noshuffle", ......, "Human", "<", "euchre_test50.in", and just matching the command line arguments that were provided/that you want into your debugger.

Also reminder, the args in your json file are take in order as if they were written into the command line, so you need to make sure that you have all of your 12 inputs for euchre.cpp first in your args, and then just add your input redirection after in the same style.


# **Question 463**: In euchre_test01.html for Hand 0 the output is:  Hand 0 Edsger deals Nine of Hearts turned up Fran orders up Hearts  The explanation states:  Edsger’s Hand: J of Clubs, A of Spades, K of Diamonds, J of Spades, 9 of Hearts  So since Edsger's hand has 9 of Hearts, he has picked up the upcard and discarded his lowest? Is that correct?

**Answer**: correct!


# **Question 464**: When I compile and run my euchre.cpp driver file, I get this error:   libc++abi: terminating due to uncaught exception of type std::out_of_range: vector  Whenever I index into my vectors, I use .at(), and the error message does not tell me where this error is happening. How would I go about trying to solve this?

**Answer**: I had these a few times, it is telling you that you are indexing out of range. Like a seg-fault error, you have to run in a visual debugger to look at where the code is breaking. If you want an idea of where to start, look at how much the code prints out before it breaks (your .out file updates until your code breaks). For example, if you print until the beginning of the third hand, then add a pause at the beginning of the hand and skip to the third one, then slowly continue through the code until the fault occurs.




# **Question 465**: We are running the game and we are not sure what is causing for the right cards to not be dealt to the players. We were wondering if we can get some help with what potential functions could be causing the issue. Could it possibly be the shuffle function or are there other functions that could cause the error

**Answer**: shuffle could definitely be the answer, whether its the implementation or where its called in your code. you could also have an issue with when your "next" is being reset to 0. if your deal function is correct, those are the main places i'd look!


# **Question 466**: For any testcase in which there is no shuffle, my program has the correct output. However, when there is shuffling involved, my code seems to be dealing the wrong cards.   In the test, euchre_test01, the first card to turn up should be Nine of Hearts, however, my code is turning up Nine of Diamonds. I've really looked hard at my shuffle function but can't seem to see what could be causing the problem. I made this a private post with my code just for some assistance on what could be going wrong.   

**Answer**: With a very brief glance, your code looks pretty good to me. I would recommend setting up the visual debugger and using it to see if your shuffle function is working as expected.




# **Question 467**:   Hi, I wrote the taking-in commend line part of euchre.cpp (I'm putting my code in as a reference) and was trying to test it out, but I think I might have implemented the debugger wrong. I don't really understand what these errors mean. thanks!

**Answer**: Your debugger is set up correctly, you just have an error in your program and need to debug it. We covered this exact situation in Lab 5 (Pokemon Debugging).


# **Question 468**: Are we allowed to use maps in euchre.cpp?

**Answer**: Based on the spec, I assume no.




# **Question 469**: Whenever I try to go and debug euchre.exe, since I can't put in the parameters that euchre needs in int main, it exits the code prematurely and returns 1, and it doesn't allow me to go and debug. Is there something I need to do differently, or am I unable to put in the arguments necessary for euchre.cpp/euchre.exe?   I've also tried setting the breakpoints in different places after or before where it checks if the arguments are put in correctly but it still exits prematurely. 

**Answer**: Have you tried following this tutorial on adding the arguments inside your .json file in order to run the debugger using command line arguments so that it doesn't fail out like you mentioned?

Here is an example that might help:

Using the args you can input command line prompts in order to configure the debugger to run as it would if you pasted the ./euchre.cpp pack.in..... command line from the spec sheet into your command line as shown here and also outlined in the tutorial I hyperlinked above.

Hopefully that helps.




# **Question 470**: Hey!  What is the recommeneded way to gurantee the success of the Euchre Game ADT? Those tests would only run after the due date has passed?  How would I go about making a custom correct output file or are these any available tests I can use other than the provided public ones?

**Answer**: Trying to make whole game tests is hard, but if you implemented your tests as suggested with a class and class functions, you can do unit testing on those functions instead. Also, you can run whole games but only test specific things, such as running an entire game to make sure that the dealer changes correctly rather than looking at every single aspect of the game.




# **Question 471**: I was checking my void shuffle function and found that if I only shuffle the deck 5 times instead of 7, I pass all the public tests, yet if I do the 7 listed within the spec, I fail one of the tests.   The issue is if I listen to the spec and implement 7 shuffles, I fail the pack public tests portion.   Has anybody came across this problem and been able to fix it?  

**Answer**: Look at how simple the pack public test is. It only checks the first card! I would look more thoroughly using a debugger to see if one individual shuffle is correct. It is more than likely that the actual shuffle is incorrect, but it happens to put the first card in the correct spot after 5 shuffles but the wrong spot after 7. 




# **Question 472**: Hello! My partner and I coded euchre.cpp so that the 00, 01, and 50 outfiles are identical to the correct ones. However, autograder isn't taking our euchre.cpp file and giving this error:   make: *** No rule to make target 'euchre-warning-check.s'. Stop.  Since we didn't face any issues in the terminal (no segmentation fault, out of bounds error shown), we were wondering how we could go about this issue. Thanks!   By the way, I don't believe we edited the makefile at all. 

**Answer**: You have that error because your file isn't attached to the submission. The autograder isn't accepting your file because it has a capital E (i.e. should be euchre.cpp not Euchre.cpp).


# **Question 473**: Hi, when I was trying to run the debugger, I got this error. I haven't finished implementing the whole thing, which might be why it is failing. Is there a way to debug part of the code before we finish the whole thing?    Thanks!

**Answer**: Switch to the "Terminal" tab and see if your program output is there.


# **Question 474**: Good afternoon,   1) While researching best practices for writing a helper function, I came across the topic of using an anonymous namespace. Is this something we've covered that I missed or is this out of scope for this class?  2) I've read several of the posts about the STL sort() function, but I still don't see how we could use the sort() function given the additional logic requirements (trump and led card values). Am I misunderstanding how the sort function works, the specs, or both? I've gone ahead and written my own sort helper function that takes trump and led card into account. Please advise.  Very Respectfully,  TJ

**Answer**: 1 - Out of scope

2 - Read the pro-tip from the spec. 

 cards in a human player’s hand must always be printed in ascending order, as defined by the < operator in Card.hpp.

That means you don't worry about trump or led card when sorting. Just use the simple ordering from the < operator.


# **Question 475**: After each hand, how do we determine the upcard, do we reshuffle again?

**Answer**: Spec:

The dealer shuffles the deck at the beginning of each hand.




# **Question 476**: Hi! I am a bit confused with the play_card function. In the test01 correct output hand 9, the trump is spades,  the led is Jack of clubs,  and the three cards that Gabriel left in this trick are  Queen of diamonds,  nine of clubs,  and ten of clubs. In the spec, it says "If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand." So in this case, Gabriel has clubs available, and he should play ten of clubs, right? But in test01, Gabriel is playing nine of clubs instead. Could anyone clarify a bit about the logic of the play_hand function? Thanks!

**Answer**: Got the answer! The left bower's suit is the trump suit. So there is no matching for the led card suit and the available cards left. In this case, the lowest card will be played.


# **Question 477**: Can someone explain why my tests are not catching "Card Bug 10":  Card_less(const Card &a, const Card &b, Suit trump) Bug #1 - Check the behavior of the operator by comparing two cards asserting the result is correct.  I have tests that run that compare smaller and larger and assert true, larger and smaller and assert false, and the same card to assert false.   I am not sure what I am missing.

**Answer**: A few things that you could test for: using Card_less with trump and non-trump cards, left bower, right bower, and any other interesting cases you can think of. However, looking at your autograder, you already have full points for the tests so note that catching additional bugs will not give you any more points.


# **Question 478**: For the human player, I'm confused about how to implement it in Euchre. When I run it, the cout statements from the player class run as well as the euchre cout statements so then they print twice like when someone passes. Could I have some clarification on what I should be implementing for the main class for the human player   

**Answer**: Within euchre.cpp, you shouldn't have separate code for human and simple player, it should be the same. The difference between the two should be handled within Player.cpp with the overloaded functions. 


# **Question 479**: I have read over posts about this topic but I don't think I completely understand the "playing tricks" part of the Simple Player.  In the specs, it says:  When playing a card, Simple Players use a simple strategy that considers only the suit that was led. A more complex strategy would also consider the cards on the table.   If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.  Here are my questions:  Does "Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand" also consider the trump suit? For example, if a simple player p1 has NINE HEARTS, QUEEN HEARTS, ACE CLUBS, NINE DIAMONDS, TEN DIAMONDS, the led suit is SPADES, and trump suit is HEARTS, does p1 play NINE DIAMONDS because NINE HEARTS is a trump card?  In https://edstem.org/us/courses/71004/discussion/6332622, the student describes that Simple Player Gabriel plays NINE CLUBS instead of TEN CLUBS from hand when the led suit is CLUBS and the trump suit is SPADES because the left bower's suit is also the trump suit and therefore there are no matching cards. To reword this, is this because the led card JACK CLUBS specifically is considered a trump suit, and therefore Simple Player cannot consider playing CLUBS? Does that mean Simple Players shouldn't play the highest valued led suit card when the led suit is considered a trump?  e.g. trump: HEARTS, led card: JACK DIAMONDS hand: KING DIAMONDS, QUEEN DIAMONDS, TEN DIAMONDS If the above is true, in this case, should the player play TEN DIAMONDS instead of KING DIAMONDS because: • JACK DIAMONDS is also considered trump, and therefore DIAMONDS is unplayable for Simple Player who can only consider led suit. I'm confused as to why this matters in the first place, because the player has matching led suit cards (DIAMONDS) and should play the highest card which is KING DIAMONDS.   I apologize if my question is all over the place and for bombarding you with questions, but I really want to understand this. Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you in advance.   

**Answer**: 1. Yes, the lowest card does consider trump suit.

2. In this case, when we say follow suit if possible, that means try to follow with the suit Spades, since the Jack of Clubs is the left bower and therefore should be considered to have the suit Spades. I wouldn't say that Clubs is unplayable.

3. Once again, it's not that Diamonds is unplayable, but rather we consider the led suit to be Hearts. So yes, the player should play Ten of Diamonds.


# **Question 480**: I think my implementation for add_and_discard() function might be wrong for HumanPlayer.   For add_and_discard(), it is prompting the user to enter the number corresponding to the card they want to discard (or - 1 if they want to discard the upcard).   Question 1: Is this "number corresponding to the card" the index of the card in player's hand? or is it the number represented in the enum list?   Question 2: If my add_card() function sorts the hand, and I call the add_card() function in the add_and_discard() function, how do we generally know that this sort algorithm will use the < operator I defined in card.cpp? Isn't sort() function part of the <algorithm> library?

**Answer**: 1. Index.

2. The sort function will attempt to sort the cards using operator< of the object (a Card) that it is trying to sort, which you have previously defined.


# **Question 481**: Hello, I just had a doubt going back to player.cpp. For the function add_discard, are we allowed to add the upcard to the hand even if the hand already has 5 cards? After adding the ucpard, I just check to see what is the lowest and discard that one, ending up with a final hand vector that is 5 elements and that meets the max_hand_size =5 . I saw in another post that you can also discard before you add, but that seems to complicate things a bit, so just wanted to check if adding and then discarding is also valid. Tahnks

**Answer**: Running the add_card function requires that you have less than MAX_HAND_SIZE cards as part of the invariant, so running it before discard is probably not the best approach. You can discard before adding without complicating things too much. 


# **Question 482**: I am having an issue with running my tests where I have tests which are being run through a loop to check multiple cards. I added more tests to this and now part of it is failing. I want to use cout statements to show me the specific result of each test within my TEST(less_than), but when I run the program on my computer, the printed statements are omitted from the output in the terminal, even though they appear on the autograder's output. Also, it seems like if onr ASSERT_ TRUE(), etc statement fails while the loop runs, but others don't, my terminal does not catch that the test failed, however, the autograder output does seem to catch this.  What can I do to see what I cout <<  and to catch failures within the loop in my terminal?  Autograder Terminal output:  Running test: constructors PASS Running test: is_functions PASS Running test: less_than Ace of Hearts Ace of Clubs1 Ace of Hearts Ace of Diamonds1 Ace of Hearts Nine of Spades1 Ace of Hearts Ten of Spades1 Ace of Hearts Queen of Spades1 Ace of Hearts King of Spades1 Ace of Hearts Ace of Spades1 Ace of Hearts Jack of Clubs1 Ace of Hearts Jack of Spades1 Ace of Clubs Ace of Diamonds1 Ace of Clubs Nine of Spades1 Ace of Clubs Ten of Spades1 Ace of Clubs Queen of Spades1 Ace of Clubs King of Spades1 Ace of Clubs Ace of Spades1 Ace of Clubs Jack of Clubs1 Ace of Clubs Jack of Spades1 Ace of Diamonds Nine of Spades1 Ace of Diamonds Ten of Spades1 Ace of Diamonds Queen of Spades1 Ace of Diamonds King of Spades1 Ace of Diamonds Ace of Spades1 Ace of Diamonds Jack of Clubs1 Ace of Diamonds Jack of Spades1 Nine of Spades Ten of Spades1 Nine of Spades Queen of Spades1 Nine of Spades King of Spades1 Nine of Spades Ace of Spades1 Nine of Spades Jack of Clubs1 Nine of Spades Jack of Spades1 Ten of Spades Queen of Spades1 Ten of Spades King of Spades1 Ten of Spades Ace of Spades1 Ten of Spades Jack of Clubs1 Ten of Spades Jack of Spades1 Queen of Spades King of Spades1 Queen of Spades Ace of Spades1 Queen of Spades Jack of Clubs1 Queen of Spades Jack of Spades1 King of Spades Ace of Spades1 King of Spades Jack of Clubs1 King of Spades Jack of Spades1 Ace of Spades Jack of Clubs1 Ace of Spades Jack of Spades1 Jack of Clubs Jack of Spades1 FAIL Running test: next_suit PASS Running test: operators PASS Running test: return_suit_with_trump PASS  *** Results *** ** Test case "constructors": PASS ** Test case "is_functions": PASS ** Test case "less_than": FAIL In ASSERT_TRUE(Card_less(trump_and_led_rankings[i], trump_and_led_rankings[j], led_card, trump)), line 174: Expected true, but was false  ** Test case "next_suit": PASS ** Test case "operators": PASS ** Test case "return_suit_with_trump": PASS *** Summary *** Out of 6 tests run: 1 failure(s), 0 error(s)   My terminal's output:  

**Answer**: i don't know what's causing your output to be omitted from your local terminal, but you might be able to work around it by replacing those specific cout statements with cerr, then writing, in addition to and at the end of the rest of your terminal arguments,  "2> output.txt" (or whatever you want the output file to be named).

9 times out of 10 i feel like with differences between local and autograder's pass/fails, it's undefined behavior that the local program isn't catching. for that, i would try running it with a sanitizer. otherwise, it could be an issue with your loop logic that i can't fix because i can't look at your code. let me know if the other stuff works tho or if you have any other vague details you can provide!!


# **Question 483**: I have a  query about how the autograder uses the test cases we write. Are these test cases just for us to check our code for bugs or are these actually used by the autograder for grading?  In a scenario, where my code implementation is correct but I write an incorrect test case ( i.e. expected output and actual do not match ) but actual output is correct, would the autograder deduct points?  I am trying to understand how the test cases I write are used by the autograder.    

**Answer**: The autograder grades your test cases in two ways:

1. seeing if they can catch the bugs against the autograder's buggy implementations (Ex of this on AG is "Mutation Testing Suites")

2. against your own code (Ex of this on AG is "Student Card tests on Student Card")

Therefore, to get full points, you need to have test cases that produce correct output, as well as code that passes your own test cases!


# **Question 484**: We are confused what long functions mean and where in euchre.cpp the issue is occurring.

**Answer**: I think it means there is a function in your euchre.cpp that exceeds the AG threshold for length of functions. In other words a function in euchre.cpp is way too long


# **Question 485**: Hi,  I was wondering when checking the command line arguments in euchre.cpp, would we have to account for situations where the type of the argument is not the expected type? For example, if the input is:  ./euchre.exe noshuffle 1 Adi Simple Barbara Simple Chi-Chih Simple Dabbala Simple pack .in  My code currently assumes that the fourth argument is an integer, and the above input causes an error but does not cause the error message (that was specified in the spec) to print. I was wondering if we need to account for cases like this, or if we just need to check for the 4 errors that are in the project spec.  There are exactly 12 arguments, including the executable name.  Points to win the game is between 1 and 100, inclusive.  The shuffle argument is either shuffle or noshuffle.  The types of each of the players are either Simple or Human.  Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

**Answer**: The project spec tells you exactly what to account for. Assuming this is the same as previous projects, you wouldn't have to worry about anything else and can assume that the user inputs things correctly, just like the rest of the project!


# **Question 486**: Hi,   In my euchre.cpp I didn't do a shuffle() function but instead just did a if-then statement that would call the shuffle function in pack.cpp to shuffle the deck depending on the input. However, the shuffle does not seem to work properly with test01. The deck does get shuffled, but in a different order than it is supposed to (I think). My code passes test 00 and the checkpoints to Pack.cpp, so I'm just wondering why it is not working with euchre.cpp.     Thank you!

**Answer**: I had a similar problem until I realized I was not adding and discarding after making trump if that helps. If not, you can also make a print function for pack and print pack before every hand and deal yourself manually from the pack that prints and see if it matches the hands in the spec for the players.


# **Question 487**: What might be the reason that when I run euchre cpp in human player mode, sometimes the order of the card in each player's hand will change?

**Answer 0**: could it be your shuffle function?

do you mean in across a single run of the program or across multiple runs of the program?
**Answer 1**: #631 


# **Question 488**: What's the difference between euchre public tests and euchre public tests with card? My implementation is passing with cards, but not the regular one.   

**Answer**: See P3 FAQ!


# **Question 489**: Hi, I am really confused. I use debugger to check my function. what might be the reason that some player have correct card order and some do not?

**Answer 0**: could it be your shuffle function?
**Answer 1**: When are you reordering your cards so that they print correctly? I find it helpful to reorder them 1) after all of the cards are dealt, and 2) whenever you add a new card to your hand. Don't forget those special cases when a dealer picks up a card!


**Answer 2**: Took a look at your AG- looks like the issue is in sorting the cards. make sure you are sorting the hand any time the hand is modified.


# **Question 490**: Basically the title, but why does the pack.in argument exist? Isn't every deck always going to be the four suits of 9, 10, J, Q, K, A?  Or are there other rules with modified decks?

**Answer**: While I'm not a Euchre expert, I believe the game is always played with a pack stripped down to 24 cards. The benefits of reading in a pack from input is that you can have some random ordering of those 24 cards. Imagine a world where we only had the default Pack constructor, even with shuffling, the order of the cards would be deterministic, leading to great predictability and a not-that-fun game. However, with this custom constructor that reads from an input stream, you can actually change the order of the cards in the file, and thus, how they will be dealt later on.




# **Question 491**: My files pass the test cases when all of my files are run together, but when solution files are provided, my euchre.cpp fails the test cases. I suspect that there is probably a print statement within my player.cpp that is supposed to be in euchre.cpp or vice versa, but other than combing through every function detailed in the spec, I was wondering if there was a more direct method to debug or find out which errors were returned by the test cases with the provided solution files as the autograder does not give any more info other than that I failed the test cases.

**Answer**: You are correct in that there are print statements in player.cpp that should be in euchre.cpp. I would look through your player.cpp to make sure you are not printing anything in there as all printing should be handled by euchre.cpp.


# **Question 492**: Hello,  For the euchre test 50, my code is outputting correctly, except for one extra space printed after the human dealer orders up. However, after all other order ups, there is a new line space so I was wondering what the spacing conventions were for ordering up. Example from diff checker included below where the left is the correct output, and the right is my output:   All other order ups except this one do have a space afterwards.

**Answer**: Every 'order up' statement should have exactly one newline after it.

After the player[i]->make_trump() (simple or human player) function is called, there should also be a newline printed, independent of what is printed inside player[i]->make_trump().




# **Question 493**: Hi, I have a add_discard issue. Suppose in hand 1, Judea is the dealer and he also orders up the diamond to be trump. And the upcard is Jack of Diamond. Then based on the rule he can choose a card to replace. My code can choose the card to be replaced. But after that it does not show that the card is replaced.   what might be the problem here?  

**Answer**: Hmmm, can I see your code for add_and_discard?




# **Question 494**: For game, I had my game function take all the arguments and store that in the game class. However, it's telling me this is too many arguments. Should I instead make different functions that set different things? Like a function that sets the players for example.

**Answer**: What is telling you that there are too many arguments? Is it the autograder? If so, yes, it's good practice to break things up into different functions. 


# **Question 495**: How does this point system work in Euchre?   The extent of my knowledge is that if someone within a pair wins a trick, then they get a point for their pair. Then, the pair with the highest amount of points win.  However, I know there are contingencies, but it is unclear how many there are and what we have to account for. Can someone explain the point system for Euchre please and thank you!

**Answer**: Here's an example with Team A and B.

If team A scored more points than team B

If they ordered up the trump card

if they won all five tricks: 2 points (and this is a "march")

If they won 3+ tricks: 1 point

If they did not order the trump card

They get 2 points (team B got "euchred")



Vice versa for team B. (Sorry if I made a mistake in here)

# **Question 497**: When running the 01 euchre tests, in hand 1 (during the leading trick section) the suits of cards being played by players become addresses because of play_card() I think. I don't know why this occurs.  The value of played_card is the result of played_card(), highest_card tracks the highest card that's been played in a trick.

**Answer**: it’s hard to know what’s going on without seeing your code. I would try to come to office hours or make a more detailed private post. 


# **Question 498**: Hello, when implementing game class and main in euchre.cpp, should we include a destructor. I know we manually free the memory at the end per the project spec, so technically a destructor wouldn't be needed, right? I'm just a bit confused because the player class in player.hpp had one. Thanks

**Answer**: only include a destructor for game if the default one is not enough. For example, if you had player pointers which were dynamically allocated as member variables (ie. you called new in the constructor), you would need a destructor to free that memory.


# **Question 499**: Hi, where should the game class functions be implemented? Outside or inside the game class definition? Since there is no .hpp file I am bit confused. Like this functions:  void shuffle(); void deal(/* ... */); void make_trump(/* ... */); void play_hand(/* ... */);     Also, so The /*...*/ refer to parameters that we need to include that each each function takes?  Thanks

**Answer**: You can implement them right in the class. Also yeah the  /*...*/ is just potential parameters for each function


# **Question 500**: How should we test our Game class in order to best prepare for the private cases? We already have all our unit testing for the other classes like Card, Player, and Pack and have passed the autograder tests so far, but want to further test our code to make sure the game functions properly. All of our functions in the Game class are private so we wouldn't be able to test them so the only public function we could use would just be our general play() function that just runs through the entire game.   Is there any way we could further test our code, or is passing the public tests enough?    Thanks.

**Answer 0**: I think if you make your own correct implementation for a certain scenario and put it in an out file you can test in the same way you did for the others.
**Answer 1**: I think it’s useful to play with a shuffled pack with 3 simple players and one human player that you control. that way, you can change the cards you play and make sure the game behaves as it should, while still testing the simple player. 


# **Question 501**: Hi, i just want to double check do we need to consider the case when a human player wrongly orders up a suit that is not the upcard's suit in round 1? For instance, if the upcard is a diamond, but in round one a human player tries to input "Hearts", should we regard this as the human player passes, or reprompt for a correct input? Or should we just assume that they know the rules?

**Answer**: You can just assume that they know the rules


# **Question 502**: Hi, how does the game work in terms of shuffling. If the argument is shuffle (and not noshuffle) is the pack shuffled once at the start of the game or every hand?

**Answer**: at the start of every hand


# **Question 503**: Hi,  When testing with output files and diff checker with terminal, the output appears the exact same, however in autograder, one of the tests (01) is giving an error. Given the terminal output is exactly as expected, I can only assume that the error is either:  1. A whitespace error (although diff checker shows no errors; perhaps something with endl vs \n?)  2. Something I have in my card, player, pack which is not in the solution files because it should be in my euchre.cpp.  Either way, I'm not sure to go about the best way of debugging this, as we cannot see the output on autograder? Any tips for solving this issue?

**Answer**: I assume you’re failing the euchre.cpp with solution card, pack and player tests. this means that when card, pack and player are all correct, your euchre file produces incorrect output. this is usually due to the fact that you are printing output in the wrong file (ie. calling print hand in euchre.cpp instead of player.cpp) 


# **Question 504**: There is a Pack Private Test section in the Autograder but it doesn't want me to submit Pack_tests.cpp.   

**Answer**: yep, this is intended behavior. the AG does not grade student provided pack tests like it does for card and player, so it won’t let you submit it. 


# **Question 505**: Hi, I noticed that each time I play, I am always getting the same upcards to start off the game. Is this normal or is there something wrong with my code?

**Answer**: This is expected. Our shuffle function is not random, and all the provided public tests read the pack from the pack.in file. To get different upcards, you’d have to start with a different pack file. 


# **Question 506**: Hi, Should we always write helper function as private function? And should I write RME for helpers?

**Answer**: It depends on which file you are referring to. If you are referring to euchre.cpp, it's up to you. If you are referring to other files, you should think about if you write helper function as private function, do you need to modify the corresponding .h file? If so, you can't, because you are not turning in .h file to AG. Also, check the second Requirements and Restrictions from the spec.

RME for helpers - good practice but not required for grading.






# **Question 507**: For some reason, euchre.cpp test gives a different output in the autograder than in the terminal. I checked the previous posting, but I am still not sure what the issue is. Thank you so much for helping!

**Answer**: I'd take a look at your Game constructor and see if there is anything else it needs to do/initialize.




# **Question 508**: I have tried many times on modifying player_test cpp and considered many edge cases, but still cannot get full credit. Are there any suggestions? Thanks.

**Answer 0**: I'd say go through the spec to make sure you are testing every possible edge case. That's what worked for me.
**Answer 1**: test the left bower (leading, playing, add and discard)

specifically, in situations where playing/leading/adding another card could be seen as the better option when examining rank alone, but the correct choice is the bower

test when a player has all trump (leading/playing)

test when a player has no trump (leading/playing)

tests the conventions of "following suit"

what suit is the left bower considered to be?

what card should the simple player play if they cannot follow suit?

test add and discard in both cases (adding, or keeping the original card)

test with trump and bowers

test make trump

Hopefully this helps. A lot of test cases are going to be concerning the bowers, but make sure you're testing all the functions you wrote in player.cpp

and if all else fails, we have office hours today and tomorrow.


# **Question 509**: For example, during round 2 of making trump, if the upcard is a diamond, and a player has one Jack of Hearts, would that be considered a face of the next suit (hearts -> order up) or is it a face first suit (diamonds -> can't order up)?   This is from the specs for round 2 of making trump "They will order up if that would mean they have one or more cards that are either face or ace cards of the trump suit in their hand (the right and left bowers, and Q, K, A of the order-up suit)." So from my example above, would the right bower in this case be Jack of Hearts, left bower is Jack of Diamonds?  

**Answer 0**: In this case, hearts would be ordered up, so Jack of hearts would be the right bower.
**Answer 1**: Youssef answered correctly, for given a trump suit, the right and left bower are also members of that suit. So if you are in Round 2 of making trump and the upcard is Diamonds (and the suit now being considered is Hearts), then yes, the Jack of Hearts (right bower) and Jack of Diamonds (left bower) would both be considered as face/ace cards that contribute.




# **Question 510**: Hi, I have a code duplication for my deal function in euchre.cpp, Is there any good way to avoid this? I've been suggested to use loops, but I'm not sure how to actually go about it.

**Answer**: Put the duplicated code to a function and call it!




# **Question 511**: Can I create a new function for inside of Player.cpp? The autograder says that I have deep nesting and long functions which would be avoidable if I created a function that contained the for loops and if statements. If so, would i define the function within SimplePlayer class or outside of both classes?

**Answer**: yes!


# **Question 512**: Why does Barbara lead Jack of Spades instead of Ace of Hearts after Barbara orders up the Hearts?

**Answer**: Oh, I got it. ONLY when a player's hand is all trump cards will they lead the highest.


# **Question 513**: As you can see below, that adi and chi-chih only have accumulated 3 points, so they should only get 1 points. But, why did it say that they have two points?    Test case 00 file:  Hand 0 Adi deals Jack of Diamonds turned up Barbara passes Chi-Chih passes Dabbala passes Adi passes Barbara orders up Hearts  Jack of Spades led by Barbara King of Spades played by Chi-Chih Ace of Spades played by Dabbala Nine of Diamonds played by Adi Dabbala takes the trick  King of Clubs led by Dabbala Ace of Clubs played by Adi Nine of Spades played by Barbara Jack of Clubs played by Chi-Chih Adi takes the trick  Ten of Diamonds led by Adi Ten of Spades played by Barbara Nine of Clubs played by Chi-Chih Queen of Clubs played by Dabbala Adi takes the trick  Jack of Hearts led by Adi Ace of Hearts played by Barbara Ten of Clubs played by Chi-Chih Ten of Hearts played by Dabbala Adi takes the trick  Queen of Hearts led by Adi King of Hearts played by Barbara Queen of Spades played by Chi-Chih Nine of Hearts played by Dabbala Barbara takes the trick  Adi and Chi-Chih win the hand euchred! Adi and Chi-Chih have 2 points Barbara and Dabbala have 0 points  Adi and Chi-Chih win!

**Answer**: When the a team orders up a suit, if the team that didn’t order up the suit wins the hand by taking at least 3 tricks, they’ve “euchred” the other team and they get 2 points instead of 1.

To reiterate, the reason it’s 2 points instead of one is that Adi’s team won the hand when Barbara’s team ordered up the suit.


# **Question 514**: in our code, we always end up with different output but have no idea what is going wrong  it looks like our deal() gives wrong hands when shuffle = TRUE, no idea why, and feel like shuffle()  function in pack.cpp is correct ./euchre.exe pack.in shuffle 10 Edsger Simple Fran Simple Gabriel Simple Herb Simple could we get some hints?  

**Answer**: It's difficult to tell without seeing your code. Some ideas for debugging would be

Check the ordering of your cards before and after the shuffle function. Make sure next is set to 0 after shuffling - if there's an error with your shuffle() function, you'll likely see an issue here.

If the cards are shuffled correctly, check which player is set to the dealer, and walk through the card dealing steps to see if your cards are being assigned in the correct order. 

If your output is always changing, there might be some undefined behavior going on. Use autograder or address sanitizers to check for this.

The debugger will be the best way to identify the issue. If you can't figure it out, come to office hours for additional help!


# **Question 515**: When making card_less, if the ranks of the two cards are the same, how do you decide which one is greater than or less than in value? I know that the trump will be the greatest, but from there, what is the ranking of the suits.

**Answer**: If you're not considering the led card or the trump card, the ranking of suits is Diamonds > Clubs > Hearts > Spades!


# **Question 516**: Hey, in my first couple submissions, I noticed that there were private tests listed in the autograder for each of the flies, namely card, pack, player, humanplayer, etc., but in my latest submissions only the "Euchre Private Tests with Solution Card, Pack, Player" show up. Is this something I should worry about, or will my latest submissions be graded on all of the private tests even though they don't appear?  

**Answer**: If you refresh the page all the private tests should appear


# **Question 517**: All three tests are passing in my development environment, and the output diffs in the autograder look fine as well. Why am I getting these errors?

**Answer**: It looks like you have memory leaks. Make sure you are deleting all Player objects. 


# **Question 518**: Are we supposed to print out the players decision in the make_trump function for human player? or do we just modify the  order_up_suit only?

**Answer 0**: I think we're supposed to print the decision in euchre.cpp, since you print the decision for both simple players and human players. From the spec: "output that is common to both Simple and Human Players should be printed by the Euchre Game driver"
**Answer 1**: Yes, as the other student said, since the output of their choice is independent of what type of player they are, it should be printed from your euchre driver.


# **Question 519**: For the euchre driver program, after hand 0 concludes and hand 1 is dealt, all of the cards to be dealt become the two of spades. I think that this is because of an issue with closing/reopening the input stream, but I'm not sure how to correct it. 

**Answer**: If you recall, there's a function inside Pack.cpp that allows you to reset the pack. Can you think of a way you can utilize that function? You don't have to reopen the input stream. 


# **Question 520**: For the hand zero in test 01, edsgar played one card that is not supposed to be on his hand, and this problem still exist after I modified the shuffle so that it reads all card from pack.  

**Answer**: If anyone makes trump in the first round, the dealer (Edsger) picks up the upcard (nine of hearts) and discards one of the cards in their hand. This is done using the helper function add_and_discard




# **Question 521**: Creating the int main() function was pretty simple as I just had to check the errors for the command line.   I'm currently creating the Game class ADT, and I think I'm lost because creating new functions and data members to implement the play() function seems a bit too abstract.   I'm currently planning to implement my play() function based on the desired outputs written here: https://eecs280staff.github.io/euchre/#example-with-human-players  but would it be possible if you guys could lead me to a correct direction?   

**Answer**: Any behavior specific to human players should already be implemented within the human player subclass. You should treat all player objects in your game ADT as generic players and simply call the corresponding methods in player. Your game ADT should be implemented so that determining what the program should do if it’s a simple player or human player is automatically taken care of through polymorphism.

For your game ADT, I’d recommend creating more than just a play() function, for example, maybe a function to deal or a function to play a round would be helpful. Your play() function can then call these functions within it, sort of like what we did for the Pokémon battle ADT in one of the labs.

The data members of your game ADT should include anything you think that a person running the game would need to keep track of. Things like who’s playing, the cards, etc, will need to be kept track of and modified inside your game ADT. Let me know if that’s helpful and if there’s anything else I can clarify!


# **Question 522**: Hi, are we allowed to write helper functions in Player.cpp (as private functions)? I think no need to modify Player.hpp in this case? Thanks

**Answer**: Yes, just make sure to not modify the .hpp file.


# **Question 523**: Does anyone know what the final card deck order is supposed to be after shuffling? currently trying to debug for euchre_test01 and I keep turning up the nine of diamonds instead of nine of hearts after dealing. I'm trying to write individual test cases for pack so if anyone knows the order that would be very helpful!  

**Answer**: A good way to test your shuffle function is to call shuffle() on the pack 20 times- this should make the pack equal to the order of the original pack before shuffling.


# **Question 524**: My partner and I have been attempting to debug this for a while, but we can't figure out what's going wrong for Hand 9 in euchre_test01. It looks like Gabriel is playing the three cards that he's supposed to, but in the wrong order (Queen of Diamonds, Nine of Clubs, Ten of Clubs instead of Nine of Clubs, Ten of Clubs, Queen of Diamonds)    Because the Jack of Clubs, which is led by Fran, is the left bower, should we be treating the led suit as if it were spades? We attempted to change which version of get_suit we use but when we use get_suit(trump) we end up seeing even more output differences.  Can we please get a hint on where we might be going wrong? Thank you so much!

**Answer**: Because the Jack of Clubs, which is led by Fran, is the left bower, should we be treating the led suit as if it were spades? We attempted to change which version of get_suit we use but when we use get_suit(trump) we end up seeing even more output differences.

Yes, Fran is leading with spades as the led suit because the jack of clubs is the left bower. You should change the version of get_suit you use in the play_card and lead_card functions (always consider the LB as part of the trump suit when trump is decided). Unfortunately, the other issues you are getting as a result of this were probably separate issues that haven't come up until now.


# **Question 525**: In Player.cpp several of our functions had too much nesting, so we wrote helper functions to help with that. Since these helper functions were all in SimplePlayer, do we need to make them static or any type of other notation (like const, etc)? They are public functions in SimplePlayer. Also, for the parameters for these helper functions, should we pass them in by reference or const (since other given Player functions do not)? Thanks!

**Answer**: They should be private member functions, or static, out of class helper functions. All other design choices are up to you. Conventionally we will pass an object by const reference if it is large to avoid making a copy.


# **Question 526**: My euchre.cpp crashed in for test.01 while the test stopped after the second hand is dealt but no upcard was turned up. The debugger seemed to show an out of bound error. I don't know what's going on because the pack size is 24 which is not out of bound. I'm wondering from what direction can I can explore the potential bug?  I added break point for these lines.      // Upcard is the first of the rest 4 remaining in pack     upcard = pack.deal_one();     cout << upcard << " turned up" << endl;     hand++;    Hand 1 Fran deals /usr/include/c++/13/array:202: constexpr std::array<_Tp, _Nm>::value_type& std::array<_Tp, _Nm>::operator[](size_type) [with _Tp = Card; long unsigned int _Nm = 24; reference = Card&; size_type = long unsigned int]: Assertion '__n < this->size()' failed.

**Answer**: The debugger put you in C++ library code which isn't helpful. You need to traverse the call stack and start looking at the variables in your own code. We covered this exact situation in Lab 5 (Pokemon Debugging),  you can revisit those exercises if you forgot how to do that.




# **Question 527**: In Hand 0, when a King of Diamonds is led by Edsger, why does Gabriel play a Nine of Clubs, since he also has a Jack of Diamonds in his hand that he plays later? Shouldn't the simple player strategy dictate that he follows suit by playing his Jack of Diamonds?

**Answer 0**: Check out this explanation document

https://eecs280staff.github.io/euchre/euchre_test01.html
**Answer 1**: You should assume Jack of Diamonds (the left bower) is a trump and in this case a Hearts.




# **Question 528**: The autograder is not giving the correct output. One of the tests is printing correctly, but the others are not printing. The tests are passed on my computer.

**Answer**: #654


# **Question 529**: Managed to get the correct output for both the Euchre00 and the Euchre01 Simple Player tests, word for word, player for player, card for card. After compiling, I noticed a random segmentation fault when I ran ./euchre.exe pack.in shuffle 10 Edsger Simple Fran Simple Gabriel Simple Herb Simple> output. I kept running this command without recompiling it to try and recreate this error, but I could only do so about once every hundred or so times. Every other time it would work perfectly fine and return the correct output. There's no pattern to it, and I believe I set up the sanitizer correctly, but it isn't telling me anything either. Anyone have any ideas on what could be happening here?  

**Answer**: I would take a look at the AG for guidance here- looks like you're getting some undefined behavior. Specifically, you're indexing with an index of -1. In player.cpp, you set an index to -1 in a few cases. I think there are some cases in your code where the index is not set to another value before being used.


# **Question 530**: we are getting heap UAF error on what seems to be add and discard? I'm a little confused. It wouldn't be related to the player objects (we weren't supposed to call dtors on them in main anyways right?) so the only thing that made sense was the vector.erase in add and discard, since a vector is on the heap usually. However the spec told us to use v.erase(v.start + index) to erase cards, so I'm not really sure what is up.

**Answer**: Look at the line numbers in the error message. You're deleting a player in the test, but then using add_and_discard on that player afterwards.


# **Question 531**: Hi, is there any tip or hint as to how to check that the number of points is between 1 and 100. I'm having trouble because the argument is a string so I don't know how I could compare it to an int.  Thanks

**Answer**: Convert the string to an int first, then do the comparison.


# **Question 532**: Are the style checks shown in the autograder the only styles that are being checked? If we get full marks on all the style checks after submitting, can we assume that there are no further style problems with the code and we will receive full points for that portion when the final grade comes out?

**Answer**: For style checks, what you see is what you get.




# **Question 533**: The order of our pack after shuffling is incorrect. Cards 9 and 19 are switched, while the rest of the pack is in order. We verified that the order of cards during pack_in is correct, and Pack.cpp passes all public and private tests.   Is there any reason why these specific cards might be out of order?  

**Answer**: It's difficult to say without looking at your code. I would try examining your shuffle function using the visual debugger. If you've already tried that, come to office hours or make a private post with your code.


# **Question 534**: When testing with output files and a diff checker in the terminal, the output appears to be exactly the same as the expected result.However, when submitted to the autograder, it gets stuck and shows an exit status of 250. Any idea what might be causing this? Thanks!

**Answer**: Yes- you have undefined behavior. I think it comes from using std library functions incorrectly, specifically min_element. you shouldn't need to use these functions to complete the project, so maybe try rewriting these sections without it.


# **Question 535**: Not quite sure what this means — does this suggest an issue with the play_card function?  Any insights would be appreciated. Thanks!

**Answer**: Have you accidentally defined a function inside a function? I have made this post private so you can add a screenshot of your play_card function.




# **Question 536**: Hello, I did my code but I didn't need to use pack.reset() or pack.empty() that I implemnted as specified in pack.cpp. I am afraid I might have not understood part of the game and you need to reset the pack somewhere (for example). Any help? Thanks

**Answer**: You should be resetting the pack between every hand because cards are re-shuffled (as per the shuffle/noshuffle argument) and re-dealt at the beginning of every hand.




# **Question 537**: How many points will I lose for this on my final grade?

**Answer**: While I don't know the answer to your question regarding exact points, remember that there are private tests that will be run after the deadline. The correctness that the private tests check for may or may not be related to the correctness that these orange test cases check for (I say this ambiguously because I truly don't know). If you have time, I would encourage you to get these tests passing because the tests you see are not the only tests that relate your final score.




# **Question 538**: I am not sure what parameters to include for the make_trump member function in the game class. I am just unsure because we already have a make_trump function in the player.cpp implementation so how would these two functions differ in terms of implementation if they do the same thing? I am thinking that they should have the same arguments but i wanted to confirm.  

**Answer**: Remember, the design of Game::make_trump is completely up to you! One thing to consider is that Player::make_trump will be called for every single Player at your table until someone orders up (for up to two rounds). Thus, it might make sense to put those (potential) 8 function calls into the Game::make_trump function. This is also a great place to add the cout statements for when someone passes/orders up (see the euchre_test00.out.correct for an example of you need to output). Does this help? 


# **Question 539**: I really don't know why it could happen. I have reset the pack and then shuffled it.

**Answer**: Can you go to the euchre_test01.out file and see how much output is actually written to it? Specifically, determine where in execution the issue lies (how many hands/tricks do you get through before execution halts). This may be a problem better solved in office hours. 




# **Question 540**: I don't know how only one of the cards could be different. I don't think it's a problem with shuffle so I don't know what it could be.

**Answer**: See that  Nine of Hearts is also the upcard for this hand and Edsger is the dealer. Thus, based on that information, the issue is probably related to the add_and_discard function (i.e. you did not call it at all, you did not call it on the dealer, or the logic in the function is causing you to discard the wrong card). 




# **Question 541**: Our group is struggling really bad with figuring out the false positives within our code, and we cannot seem to find the final bug no matter what we tried. Any help would be appreciated.

**Answer 0**: Just in case you were not sure (sorry if you are aware), a false positive means that some example you work out in a test is wrong, rather than your function implementation (however, that might need a fix as well). It's likely that there is small misunderstanding of what the add_and_discard function is actually supposed to return given specific inputs. Thus, what you need to fix first are the tests!

Can you show me what those two tests look like?


**Answer 1**: For the first test, Diaz would not play the jack of hearts because the trump is diamonds. so their hand after the add and discard would be 

J hearts (the left bower)

10 diamonds

Q diamonds

K diamonds

J diamonds (the right bower)

When you call lead_card, trump = Diamonds. You can see that Diaz has only trump in their hand. So you should play the highest card in their hand. remember that the highest card is the right bower, so the J diamonds would be the correct card to play here.





For the second test, Diaz has after adding and discarding:

A diamonds

J diamonds (right bower)

K diamonds

Q diamonds

10 diamonds

Again, Diaz has only trump in their hand. In this case, the simple player plays the highest card in their hand. Remember the right bower is the highest card in the game. So the correct card is again the J of Diamonds. 


# **Question 542**: I am running into an issue in the last trick of euchre_test00 were Adi plays "Jack of Diamonds" instead of "Queen of Hearts" and Adi takes the trick instead of Barbara; Any advice would be greatly appreciated  

**Answer**: EDIT: this answer is wrong, see below! The simple player should lead with the highest non-trump card in their hand. you are leading with a trump card (the left bower, the jack of diamonds) which is a trump card. somewhere you are forgetting to check for the left bower-- a common cause of this is using the wrong get_suit function in lead/play/add and discard card. you should be using get_suit(trump) as your function.




# **Question 543**: When I ran test 01 in the terminal and checked the output with the correct output it showed there was an error, however when I submitted it to the autograder it passed the test, is there a reason this could happen? 

**Answer**: Your executable might have not been up to date?


# **Question 544**: I am getting this error on autograder for deep nesting and long functions. However when I check the line numbers that the autograder gives me for these errors (202 for long functions and 118 for deep nesting), those functions aren't long and don't have deep nesting. I'm just confused because my code seems fine.   

**Answer**: the long function one is coming from your play hand function, which starts at line 202 in the euchre.cpp you submitted.

the deep nesting comes from deal. You have two lines, lines 134 and 143, that are too deeply nested.

For both of these issues, I would recommend putting some of the code into other helper functions so that there is less nesting/ less long functions.


# **Question 545**: In the autograder, we are failing the style checks, for  few different things.   1) we are failing long function in card, it it says it's 49/40, but when we check it ourselves, it is 41/40, so we are wondering what counts towards this?  2) we are also failing deep nesting, and we're a little confused, because we have max of 4 nested loop, and we are assuming that this means how loops there are stacked? but we were wondering if it means like all of the loops on the same stack inside another loop(eg. for, then if statement insides, compared to a for loop with multiple if statements insides  3) we are also falling code dupilication because of card less, are we are wondering if we are supposed to call the card less(a,b,trump) inside of the card less (a,b,led, trump)? otherwise we are a little confused how to go about this?  

**Answer**: 1. Not sure about what counts towards this, but I would recommend maybe moving some code into separate helper functions.

2. Hmmm, I'm not sure if I answering what you're asking, but nesting means that within the curly braces of a loop, you have created another loop, for example:

for (...) {
    for (...) {
        for (...) {
            \\ this is an example of 3 nested loops!
        }
    }
}

3.  Yes, the logic for Card less (a, b, trump) is reusable so you can call it from inside Card less (a, b, led,trump) !


# **Question 546**: im running into an issue with my output for euchre. i know the issue is with make_trump. but i can't figure it out. my code is passing a player when it should be ordering up   

**Answer**: You're right, the issue is probably with Player::make_trump, however, it's hard to tell what is wrong based on just this output snippet. Here is a hint to help you figure out what might be going wrong, specifically, these are the cards that Dabbala should have in her hand (I determined this by parsing through correct output):

Ace of Spades played by Dabbala
King of Clubs played by Dabbala
Queen of Clubs played by Dabbala
Ten of Hearts played by Dabbala
Nine of Hearts played by Dabbala

Thus, Dabbala should not be ordering up--she actually has zero face/ace Diamond cards. 

Set up the visual debugger. Then, verify that these are the cards that Dabbala actually has. If not, well there is your issue. If she does have those cards, step all the way to where the Player::make_trump  is called for her and then see what things are incorrectly contributing to her face/ace count causing her to order up. 

Good luck!



# **Question 547**: Is this all we are supposed to put in shuffle?? i am passing the public test so i thought it was fine I'm really confused on what I am supposed to put in shuffle because the output of the cards that are supposed to be assigned to a person are not assigned correctly.  void Pack::shuffle() {     next=0;     for (int i = 0; i < 7; ++i) {         Card temp[PACK_SIZE];         int left = 0,right = PACK_SIZE/ 2, index=0;          while (right<PACK_SIZE) {             temp[index++]=cards[right++];             temp[index++]=cards[left++];         }          for (int j=0;j< PACK_SIZE;++j){             cards[j]=temp[j];         }     }      }  

**Answer**: When you are asking about "what you should put in shuffle", I'm not sure if you are asking about Game::shuffle() or Pack::shuffle(), will you clarify for me?

The public test for Pack::shuffle() is very simple, so it does not guarantee that your function is correct. I would set up the visual debugger and use that to make sure every location is correct. If you are sure your Pack::shuffle() is correct and you are still not passing euchre_test50, then I would recommend looking at your Game::deal() function, it could be the case you are dealing incorrectly to players. 








# **Question 548**: In the spec sheet, it says a test file cannot have more than 50 test cases. Will I lose points if my player_tests.cpp file has more than 50 test cases? Is one test case considred to be one ASSERTION statement?  

**Answer**: I would follow what the spec sheet is for best practice, but I cannot say for sure if you will lose points for not. Hmmm, I would call one test function a test case, rather than every ASSERTION.




# **Question 549**: Fran orders up hearts when the nine of hearts is flipped. In the same hand, Edsger has the nine of hearts in his hand rather than Fran. Why?

**Answer**: See this section in the spec:

If the trump suit is ordered up during round one, the dealer picks up the upcard. The dealer then discards the lowest card in their hand, even if this is the upcard, for a final total of five cards. (Note that at this point, the trump suit is the suit of the upcard.)

Since Fran orders up during round one of making trump, Edsger (who is the dealer) picks up the upcard (which is the Nine of Hearts) and then discards the lowest card in his hand.

Hopefully that clarifies things!


# **Question 550**: The order of our pack after shuffling is incorrect. Cards 9 and 19 are switched, while the rest of the pack is in order. We verified that the order of cards during pack_in is correct, and Pack.cpp passes all public and private tests.   Is there any reason why these specific cards might be out of order? This is our code for shuffle:       Card shuffle[PACK_SIZE];      for(int j = 0; j < 7; j++)     {         for (int i = 0; i < PACK_SIZE/2; i+=1)         {             shuffle[i * 2] = cards[i + (PACK_SIZE / 2)];             shuffle[i*2 +1] = cards[i];         }          for(int i = 0; i < PACK_SIZE; i++)           {             cards[i] = shuffle[i];           }     }          next = 0;

**Answer**: Hmmm, your code looks pretty good to me after a quick glance. One question I have: is this causing you to fail the tests later on, specifically for the euchre.cpp driver? I ran this function locally in lieu of my own and everything seems to work correctly. I get the same ordering by running your function as compared to my own.  How did you come to determine that Card 9 and 19 are switched?  









# **Question 551**: What would be the cause for something like this:   The right is what we expect and the left is my output. Why would the second person and on have different hands but the first one is the same. And can anyone maybe touch on how I could go about fixing it?

**Answer**: Note that you actually have the all the correct cards for the second Player, they are just not in the right order. My guess would be that you failed to sort them somewhere in the Human Player class functions, but otherwise, they seem to be correct. Recall this Pro-Tip that talks about sorting in the Human Player class.




# **Question 552**: My print statements are in my private functions in the Game ADT; could that be the issue? The terminal output matches perfectly.

**Answer**: No, that is okay if cout statements are in private functions, they should be executed regardless. Do you get the correct output when running locally?




# **Question 553**: Literally had no problem up until today. We failed one of the public test cases so we made edits to the code, and it passed on our laptops. When we submitted it to autograder, it did not compile at all, even though it compiles and passes on vs code without an issue.   

**Answer 0**: Look at the lines and compilation issues that the AG highlights. Check out those spots in your code and see if the actual issues exist. Verify that the copy you submitted to AG matches the copy that you have locally. 


**Answer 1**: There were no warnings or errors when running on vs code. Is there anyway to reset the vs code compiler? Any changes we made just ended up still having the code run and work. Tried to deleting the .exe file and doing make and ./ and it still ends up the same. 




# **Question 554**: why can fran not follow suit? fran's hand has the jack of clubs, so why is nine of diamonds played? 

**Answer**: Remember Spades  is the trump, which makes Jack of Clubs the left bower, and thus a Spades card for all intents and purposes. By that logic, she does not have a Clubs card.




# **Question 555**: Hello. I have a similar issue to another anonymous post where one wrong card is played in Hand 0 (when Edsger is supposed to play Nine of Hearts, he plays Ten of Diamonds in my program). I attended office hours yesterday and was told that my add_and_discard function is correctly implemented, so I have no idea what is wrong with my make_trump function that is causing incorrect gameplay. Are there any logic errors in my implementation that I haven't addressed?: Suit make_trump() {     int eldest = (dealer_index + 1) % 4;     bool is_dealer;      // first round     for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {         int player_index = (eldest + i) % 4;         is_dealer = (player_index == dealer_index);         order_up_suit = upcard.get_suit();                  if (get_player(player_index)->make_trump(upcard,              is_dealer, 1, order_up_suit)) {             if (is_dealer) {                 get_player(dealer_index)->add_and_discard(upcard);             }             cout << get_player(player_index)->get_name()              << " orders up " << order_up_suit << endl << endl;             if (player_index % 2 == 0) {                 the_maker = 1;             } else {                 the_maker = 2;             }                         trump = order_up_suit;             return order_up_suit;         } else {             cout << get_player(player_index)->get_name()              << " passes" << endl;         }     }      // second round      for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {         int player_index = (eldest + i) % 4;         is_dealer = (player_index == dealer_index);                  if (get_player(player_index)->make_trump(upcard,              is_dealer, 2, order_up_suit)) {             cout << get_player(player_index)->get_name()              << " orders up " << order_up_suit << endl << endl;             if (player_index % 2 == 0) {                 the_maker = 1;             } else {                 the_maker = 2;             }             trump = order_up_suit;             return order_up_suit;         } else {             cout << get_player(player_index)->get_name()              << " passes" << endl;         }     }     return order_up_suit; }  

**Answer**: Your issue is because you are only adding and discarding if the current player is the dealer (ie. the dealer orders up in the first round). If ANY player orders up during the first round, the dealer has the option to add the upcard and discard a card.

here's the line you need to fix:

 if (is_dealer) {

     get_player(dealer_index)->add_and_discard(upcard);

 }



# **Question 556**: Hello, I have my game constructor be the following (attached). I get an error in style check of autograder because it says maximum number of parameters  "Method with 5 parameters exceeds limit of 4". I ma wondering how I can change this, as all the information and parameters are required for the game and can't be joined. Could I possibly use a pair to combine players_to_play and type_of _players? 

**Answer**: You could try moving the portion of your code that creates the vectors players_to_play and type_of_players to happen inside the Game constructor. That way, you probably only need to pass in your argv variable instead of passing in two vectors.


# **Question 557**: My output: Ten of Diamonds led by Adi Ten of Spades played by Barbara Nine of Clubs played by Chi-Chih Nine of Hearts played by Dabbala Dabbala takes the trick  Correct output:  Ten of Diamonds led by Adi Ten of Spades played by Barbara Nine of Clubs played by Chi-Chih Queen of Clubs played by Dabbala Adi takes the trick  At time of playing, Dabbala has 9 of hearts, 10 of hearts, and queen of clubs. Trump suit is hearts and led suit is diamonds. According to simple player strategy, they should not consider trump and only consider the led card. Dabbala can't follow suit here, they should play the lowest card in their hand. I am (potentially incorrectly) interpreting this as a pure relational comparison of their ranks (9 of hearts < queen of clubs). Regardless of comparing suit or rank, 9 of hearts is definitively lower given (A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9), with ties broken by suit (D > C > H > S).  What am I missing here? Why is it that Queen of Clubs is the correct move here? The only thing I can think of is if somehow my hands have been dealt incorrectly, but the rest of my output preceding this point is correct. Thanks!

**Answer**: simple player strategy does not entirely ignore trump; if they cannot follow suit, they play the actual lowest card in their hand. according to the rules of the game, every trump card is greater than every other card.


# **Question 558**: Does the long functions style check include lines that don't have code in them? ie. just empty lines

**Answer**: No, it will only count lines with code in them, at least from what I can see, along with in the error it will say "non-commenting source statements", so it should only count lines that actually have code in them.


# **Question 559**: hi! is there any way to see if our tests return a false positive / number of bugs we expose before putting it into autograder?  follow up: if we get full points for the test cases but want to expose more bugs (to ensure we pass private tests), will we get points deducted if we have a false positive even though we have 14/14 bugs exposed without the false positive?

**Answer**: No points are deducted for false positives, but the test case that contains a false positive will not contribute to catching bugs on the autograder (because the test case is invalid)




# **Question 560**: Barbara should order up Hearts in the second round, but I don't know why it's going to Dabbala to order up? I did some debugging with cout statements in make_trump() in Player to see what was happening, and apparently Barbara's hand is:  Nine of Spades   Nine of Clubs   Ten of Spades   Ten of Clubs   Jack of Spades  That makes sense then why she wouldn't order up Hearts, so then why is her hand presumably wrong? I don't see how it could be an error in shuffling.   

**Answer**: I'd check that you are dealing out the cards in the correct order and to the correct people since you seem to have 3 of the cards that Barbara is supposed to have, however there are 2 others that shouldn't be there and instead there should be cards there that cause Barbara to order up Hearts.

Also since it is a noshuffle round you shouldn't have to worry about an error in shuffling, and it is probably something to do with how you are dealing out cards and to whom they are being delt since she isn't getting the right cards in the first place.


# **Question 561**: If the ai doesnt have card of type led card, then should it play the highest trump card it has and then if not the lowest possible card they have or should they go right to the last option?  Thank you.

**Answer**: It should go right to the last option, so play the lowest possible card.


# **Question 562**: 

**Answer**: I know this is very late, but it looks like you didn't print the command line arguments at the beginning of your output. 


# **Question 563**: I made my last submission to the autograder and it said, Core tests finished. You can submit again now! Are we supposed to make another submission or will the private tests get graded automatically?

**Answer**: The private tests will get graded automatically


# **Question 564**: If so, then how likely is that? And how "poorly" would you have had to write your code for that to happen?  I didn't write any of my own test cases for the driver, by the way... I only heard after that that it was probably a good idea to test the euchre.cpp...  

**Answer**: I believe that's very unlikely, def still possible, but you should likely be okay


# **Question 565**: When will private test scores be released? I was under the impression that they are released right after the deadline.

**Answer**: They've been released. They're usually released the morning after.


# **Question 566**: I got my final score back for project 3 and I see that my most recent submission was the one scored instead of an older one which had a higher grade on the autograder. I was under the impression that the highest submission was graded and not the most recent one. Am i missing something?

**Answer**: The final graded submission is the one that has your highest public + private test score. So that means your older submission that had a higher public test grade on the autograder probably had a lower total score.


# **Question 567**: I reviewed our private test scores and got points deducted in Player private, HumanPlayer private, and Euchre private. There is no details about the output I guess for the project reuse purposes, so I am just really curious about and want to reflect kn which exactly part that we have issues in .

**Answer**: There's most likely some edge case error in your Player/HumanPlayer. Beyond that, I'd suggest going to Proffice hours to discuss this with a professor as they are the only ones who can view the private test case output.


# **Question 568**: I was making the constructor for classifier and I just want to make sure if it is suppose to take in a csvstream. If it is, then we can use the way shown in the live for project 4 to read the information? Also in the while loop header, shouldn't it be my_csv>>row instead of csvstream>>row or no?  

**Answer**: Yep, you caught a typo. Should be my_csv instead of csvstream in the while loop header.

Feel free to use the (corrected) code in the constructor!


# **Question 569**: Does the number of unique words in the entire training set also include the labels? Or is the vocab size limited to the words found in the content?

**Answer**: Unique words should be just from the content of each post.


# **Question 570**: Can we assume that each post in the training data will be unique, or do we need to account for there being duplicates of each "bag of words" (e.g., "please help me on this project" and "help me on this project please")? If so, should we treat remove one of the duplicates, or count both in our calculation?

**Answer**: You should count both. Think of it as if you’re seeing the same words in multiple posts, it means those words are more likely to be associated with whatever label they have. If you were to discard the duplicate, it wouldn’t reflect that correctly.


# **Question 571**: How do I do the natural log of something in c++? do i need to add the cmath library?   

**Answer**: just include cmath and use log()
