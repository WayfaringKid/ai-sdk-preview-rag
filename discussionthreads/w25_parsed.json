It is safer/good practice to use size_t for the purposes of iterating through a vector because should a programmer make some mistake, having the size_t type there may help you catch that mistake (e.g. imagine you want to decrement a variable when iterating through a vector but you accidentally decrement out of bounds--however, a size_t var can't be negative). \n\n"

The width is like the area between the upper and lower bound. For example, in the RME example of 0.8 width and the interval was 90th and 10th percentile| .9 - .1 = .8 (which is the width). So, you need to find a way to get those lower and upper bounds given any width between 1 and 0. This one is pretty much a bunch of math and logic.

Or would they play the lowest card in their hand?\n\nThe LB is always considered part of the trump suit (not the suit that is printed on the card itself), so if the led suit is the trump suit, playing the left bower would be considered following suit. (this is a great edge case to test for simple player!)\n\n2) If jack is the only card you have in led suite but that is the left bower, should u still play it? \n\nNot sure exactly what you mean by this question. Let me know if this situation describes it:\n\nTrump is diamonds, and someone leads with hearts. You have the Jack of hearts (and no other cards that have hearts on them). Because trump is diamonds the Jack of Hearts is the LB.

    "answers": [
      "I think the creating 2 separate vectors is a good strategy especially since you already explored that idea. I'd be careful using push_back any time other than when you might be initializing a vector for use since push_back will increase the size of your vector and make it hard to align which card belongs to which player and this may be where you were having issues, and you might want to try just indexing instead. Remember that you can also using indexing to change the value at a specified position in the vector such as overwriting an already existing value. Also if you have 2 vectors of size 4 to hold both the players and the cards in the hand and have to go through the players around the table, you can figure out a way to keep track between the two vectors of which player played which card."

If a Simple Player can follow suit, they play the highest card that follows suit. Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand.  Here are my questions:  Does \"Otherwise, they play the lowest card in their hand\" also consider the trump suit? For example, if a simple player p1 has NINE HEARTS, QUEEN HEARTS, ACE CLUBS, NINE DIAMONDS, TEN DIAMONDS, the led suit is SPADES, and trump suit is HEARTS, does p1 play NINE DIAMONDS because NINE HEARTS is a trump card?  In https://edstem.org/us/courses/71004/discussion/6332622, the student describes that Simple Player Gabriel plays NINE CLUBS instead of TEN CLUBS from hand when the led suit is CLUBS and the trump suit is SPADES because the left bower's suit is also the trump suit and therefore there are no matching cards. To reword this, is this because the led card JACK CLUBS specifically is considered a trump suit, and therefore Simple Player cannot consider playing CLUBS? Does that mean Simple Players shouldn't play the highest valued led suit card when the led suit is considered a trump?  e.g. trump: HEARTS, led card: JACK DIAMONDS hand: KING DIAMONDS, QUEEN DIAMONDS, TEN DIAMONDS If the above is true, in this case, should the player play TEN DIAMONDS instead of KING DIAMONDS because: \u2022 JACK DIAMONDS is also considered trump, and therefore DIAMONDS is unplayable for Simple Player who can only consider led suit. I'm confused as to why this matters in the first place, because the player has matching led suit cards (DIAMONDS) and should play the highest card which is KING DIAMONDS.

Your play() function can then call these functions within it, sort of like what we did for the Pok\u00e9mon battle ADT in one of the labs.\n\nThe data members of your game ADT should include anything you think that a person running the game would need to keep track of.

Trump suit is hearts and led suit is diamonds. According to simple player strategy, they should not consider trump and only consider the led card. Dabbala can't follow suit here, they should play the lowest card in their hand. I am (potentially incorrectly) interpreting this as a pure relational comparison of their ranks (9 of hearts < queen of clubs). Regardless of comparing suit or rank, 9 of hearts is definitively lower given (A > K > Q > J > 10 > 9), with ties broken by suit (D > C > H > S).  What am I missing here? Why is it that Queen of Clubs is the correct move here? The only thing I can think of is if somehow my hands have been dealt incorrectly, but the rest of my output preceding this point is correct. Thanks!",
