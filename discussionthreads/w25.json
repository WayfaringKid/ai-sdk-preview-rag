Then in \u003ccode\u003etwo_sample.cpp\u003c/code\u003e you can use the functions created in \u003ccode\u003estats.cpp\u003c/code\u003e to implement the functions according to their RMEs in \u003ccode\u003etwo_sample.cpp\u003c/code\u003e. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYou shouldn't have to use \u003ccode\u003elibrary.cpp\u003c/code\u003e in \u003ccode\u003estats.cpp\u003c/code\u003e.  You can see that some of the functions are used in \u003ccode\u003etwo_sample.cpp\u003c/code\u003e . Let me know if you have any other questions!\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph/\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

        "text": "Hello! I know it's a bit early but I did try to solve question 1 for the fall 24 midterm to just review the contents we covered so far. I got everything right except for this last question that asks us about stack space of two functions. \n\nMy approach was:\n\n For left.cpp, the main calls the func 1. The func1 runs the loop 100 times, which then calls func2 100 times. Hence, at any given moment, the largest amount of memory needed to store the stack frame would be 101 (including the call for func1). \n\n\n\nFor right.cpp, the main runs the loop 10,000 times, and calls func 10,000 times. Hence, at any given moment, the largest amount of memory needed to store the stack frame would be 10,000. \n\n\n\nSo my answer was D where the right.cpp uses approximately 100 times more stack space than left.cpp. But the answer was A, where the program use approximately the same amount of stack space. \n\n\n\nI'm guessing that when the loop is ran, due to the last in first out principle, the stack frame of func2 for left.cpp is constantly called and removed and called and removed... which then makes me think that left.cpp uses 3 stack space at max and 2 for the right.cpp, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to think about it. \n\nWould it be possible for you guys to just shortly explain the answer? no need to go in super detail because I know that we will have a review session on these.

I know it's a bit early but I did try to solve question 1 for the fall 24 midterm to just review the contents we covered so far. I got everything right except for this last question that asks us about stack space of two functions. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eMy approach was:\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003clist style=\"bullet\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e For left.cpp, the main calls the func 1. The func1 runs the loop 100 times, which then calls func2 100 times. Hence, at any given moment, the largest amount of memory needed to store the stack frame would be 101 (including the call for func1). \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cparagraph/\u003e\u003clist style=\"bullet\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eFor right.cpp, the main runs the loop 10,000 times, and calls func 10,000 times. Hence, at any given moment, the largest amount of memory needed to store the stack frame would be 10,000. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cparagraph/\u003e\u003clist style=\"bullet\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eSo my answer was D where the right.cpp uses approximately 100 times more stack space than left.cpp. But the answer was A, where the program use approximately the same amount of stack space. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cparagraph/\u003e\u003clist style=\"bullet\"\u003e\u003clist-item\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eI'm guessing that when the loop is ran, due to the last in first out principle, the stack frame of func2 for left.cpp is constantly called and removed and called and removed... which then makes me think that left.cpp uses 3 stack space at max and 2 for the right.cpp, but I'm not sure if this is the right way to think about it. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003c/list-item\u003e\u003c/list\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eWould it be possible for you guys to just shortly explain the answer? no need to go in super detail because I know that we will have a review session on these. I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding the concepts correctly. \u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimage src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/ZmmssfYEV4pbKfJ1A27whB6R\" width=\"658\" height=\"340.85585585585585\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

        "text": "Refer to this post for Frequently Asked Questions regarding Project 2.\n\nQ: My program takes a couple minutes or more to run. Is this expected?\n\n A: Yes, but not too long - your program should run in under 45 seconds. Double check that you're not copying Matrix/Image objects without using pointers, looping unnecessarily, or calling an inefficient function within a loop. Perf is also a helpful tool for improving efficiency! https://eecs280staff.github.io/image-processing/perf.html\n\nQ: Rotate left is failing, even though it was provided. Is there an error in the provided function?\n\n A: Rotate left calls several student implemented image functions, which can cause errors in rotate left.\n\nQ: Why do I have to write functions like Matrix_width? Couldn't I just use matrix-\u003ewidth directly?\n\nA: Unless you're implementing a Matrix function, this is generally considered really poor design! We actually consider this incorrect behavior, even if you get the right results, so please make sure you use the right function. Even if it's just Matrix_width and Matrix_height, whenever you're not writing Matrix functions, go through the interface - the same goes for Image as well.\n\nQ: Do I have to respect the interface when writing tests?\n\nA: Yes, tests should always respect the interface! In the real world, this means you can reuse tests when changing the implementation to make sure that you haven't also changed the interface, such that you can avoid updating the code everywhere the interface is used!\n\nQ: How can I test Matrix_at without breaking the interface?\n\nA: When thinking of unit testing, you should think in units as behavior instead of units as functions, because it is common to have functions like Matrix_at that solely rely on the underlying implementation. When testing Matrix_at, we really want to test the behavior of setting and retrieving independent values reliably from our matrix. For example, you could test that setting a value at (0,1) doesn't modify the value at (1,0) or other similar variations of this.\n\nQ: What does it mean for the column start to be inclusive and the column end to be exclusive?\n\n A: This means that when looking for the min value, you should consider the column start but not column end. For example, if my column start was 2 and my column end was 5, I would consider columns 2,3, and 4, but not 5.\n\n Q: Why am I failing crabster but passing dog and horses?\n\nA: Crabster tends to catch more edge cases. Be sure that in all cases you're checking the correct columns when you compute the energy, cost, and seam.\n\n\nQ: One of my processing test is failing, but when I print out the output it matches the correct file.\n\n A: Double check your Image_init. If you read in the correct image incorrectly, then Image_equal will fail even if you've processed the image correctly.\n\nQ: I have a small pixel mismatch in my crabster and horse processing tests.\n\n A: You may be indexing out of bounds. Run your code with the address sanitizer to double check this is not the case. To debug this further, add assertions in your Matrix_at(), Image_get_pixel(), and Image_set_pixel() functions, then use the debugger to check for out of bounds values.\n\nQ: I am missing some test cases. What other tests should I write to catch the test cases?\n\nA: The autograder provides hints for bugs that your test cases aren't catching. These should help lead you to what additional tests you need to write.\n\nQ: What is a false positive?\n\nA: A false positive is when a correct instructor solution failed an assertion in your test case. This means that there is a logical issue in your test case. If you have a false positive test case that passes locally for you, this same logical issue may be present in your implementation. Come to office hours if you would like more in depth help on it!\n\nQ: I'm trying to run processing_public_test.cpp/resize.cpp on XCode, and Xcode is saying that it's unable to open dog.ppm/crabster.ppm/horses.ppm.\n\nA: You need to update XCode's custom working directory: Setup Xcode (macOS) | EECS 280 Tutorials",

        "text": "FAQs:\n\nQ: I’ve never played Euchre before, how do I learn the rules of the game?\n\nA: Pages 2-5 of the spec detail the rules of “EECS 280 Euchre”. You can reference the Euchre Social slides. Also, a staff member from prior semesters made a video tutorial a few years ago that may be helpful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0jGJ0NRcrc\n\n0:33 Dealing\n\n1:55 The Upcard / Making Trump Round 1\n\n5:35 Making Trump Round 2\n\n7:20 Leading the First Trick\n\n8:20 The Other Players Play Cards in the First Trick\n\n10:58 Deciding who Wins the First Trick\n\n11:24 Leading the Second Trick\n\n12:00 Playing the Rest of the Hand\n\n20:30 Scoring\n\n21:23 Determining Whether Another Hand should be Played - Ending\n\nQ: What do I have to submit to pass the checkpoint?\n\nThe checkpoint includes all the files except the driver (Card.cpp, Card_tests.cpp, Pack.cpp, Player.cpp, Player_tests.cpp). It will make up 0.5% of your overall course grade.\n\nQ: Can I add helper functions while implementing the Player classes?\n\nYou are allowed to use helper functions, but these helper functions should not change the interface of the class. So, within your implementations of the class’s member functions, feel free to call helpers. But in your test files, you should not assume that these functions exist (because you should not alter the interface for the classes). This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!\n\nThis is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.\n\nQ: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?\n\nNote that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.\n\nYou shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the \u003c operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.\n\nSimilarly: Q: I’m getting a compiler error related to swap?\n\nThis is the same question as the one above.\n\nQ: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?\n\nThis means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you’re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you’re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.\n\nQ: Why won’t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?\n\nClick on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme \u003e Options \u003e Enable “Custom Working Directory” and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.\n\nQ: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?\n\nFollow this link and click on your specific IDE, then click on the “Arguments and options” subsection.\n\nQ: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?\n\nYes, according to the spec: “First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.”\n\nQ: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?\n\nNo, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.\n\nQ: How do I test player member functions such as add_card() and add_and_discard()?\n\nYou can call play_card() repeatedly to make a player play their whole hand, and then you can check if the contents of their hand was what you expected. (Note that you cannot test by adding to the Player interface, since test cases only have access to the interface defined in Player.hpp.)\n\nQ: I am failing the euchre_test01 public test. Why is Edsger/Fran/Gabriel/Herb supposed to play the cards in euchre_test01.out.correct?\n\nCheck out the Euchre Test 01 Explanation, which is linked from the project spec.",

This also applies in your euchre driver as well! e.g. If you add a helper function to the simple player class, you can use it within that class, but you can’t use it in the driver since it won’t be part of the Player interface!\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThis is especially important because when we run your test cases against an intentionally buggy solution, that solution will not have your specially defined helper functions! So just use the interfaces of each class when you test them.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Why am I getting a compiler error for calling sort?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eNote that the sort function modifies the hand. You cannot modify member variables in a const function, so you’ll receive a compiler error you call sort in a const member function.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYou shouldn’t need to sort using card less. When you print the hand in order it should be sorted using the \u0026lt; operator. You could sort with card less when determining what action to take, but you should be able to find the min/max card in the hand without sorting. You could use a functor to sort using card less, but those are only covered later in the course. Generally: if you need to use sort, just the default one will be fine.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eSimilarly: \u003cbold\u003eQ: I’m getting a compiler error related to swap?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThis is the same question as the one above.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Why am I passing euchre public test, but failing euchre public test with solution card, pack, and player?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThis means that when your euchre.cpp is run with the instructor solution implementations of card, pack, and player you produce incorrect output. This likely means that you’re making an incorrect assumption about what functionality should go in card/pack/player versus in the game of euchre. For example, make sure that you’re not printing output in player.cpp that should be printed in euchre.cpp.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Why won’t pack.in open in pack public tests when running on Xcode?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eClick on the name of your scheme in the toolbar at the top left, Edit Scheme \u0026gt; Options \u0026gt; Enable “Custom Working Directory” and press the little folder icon. Pick the folder that contains your code along with pack.in. This will ensure that the file is visible to your executable. This is usually not a problem, and we are investigating the issue.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: How do I debug and add in command line arguments with XCode/VSCode/VS?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eFollow\u003clink href=\"https://eecs280staff.github.io/tutorials/\"\u003e this link\u003c/link\u003e and click on your specific IDE, then click on the “Arguments and options” subsection.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Should I be printing the incoming arguments from the command line?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYes, according to the spec: “First, print the executable and all arguments on the first line. Print a single space at the end, which makes it easier to print an array.”\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: Do I need to worry about the human player doing (insert illegal move) during the game?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eNo, in accordance with the spec you can assume that a human player will follow the rules of the game and will not attempt to cheat.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: How do I test player member functions such as add_card() and add_and_discard()?\u003c/bold\u003e\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eYou can call play_card() repeatedly to make a player play their whole hand, and then you can check if the contents of their hand was what you expected. (Note that you cannot test by adding to the Player interface, since test cases only have access to the interface defined in Player.hpp.)\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e\u003cbold\u003eQ: I am failing the euchre_test01 public test.

(See image of operator below)\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e(1) Is this intended behavior for the overloaded suit extraction operator?\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003e(2) If this is intended behavior for the overloaded suit extraction operator, how should I read in the suit from the in-stream? I can't assume that the suit is given in upper-case format and it seems strange to have to convert the input to upper-case before using the suit extraction operator.\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eThank you,\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eZachary Lin\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cparagraph\u003eStudent implemented card extraction operator, instructor implemented suit extraction operator, suit extraction operator exception, instructor implemented rank extraction operator (in order):\u003c/paragraph\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimage src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/3CdIimQBBPhD3jzqlugxBjeC\" width=\"623\" height=\"184.70473876063184\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimage src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/UzcQhZHb1QcuT9STBaHZqupp\" width=\"623\" height=\"200.3372549019608\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimage src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/kUEjgxfPLNdwmAzFVRLJW5LD\" width=\"623\" height=\"350.4375\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimage src=\"https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/SHeD8Vt4fVCt0qIdLst9pTQL\" width=\"623\" height=\"226.6214765100671\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/document\u003e",

In preparation for the upcoming midterm, staff will be hosting a midterm review session on Saturday, March 15th from 3pm-5pm EST over Zoom.\n\nWe'll be going over some general topics and walking through the answers to this worksheet here, leaving time at the end to answer any questions related to course concepts, exam logistics, and study strategies.

Make sure log-probabilities are not being rounded due to being stored in an incorrect type. Check our test_small explanation for a breakdown of log-probability calculations.\n\nQ: Why am I seeing an incorrect number of posts in the dataset?\n\nMake sure you are reading every row of the input files and processing each exactly once. You shouldn't need to store whole piazza posts in an intermediate data structure, but if you do, use a vector to preserve individual posts and their ordering. This contrasts to other parts of the classifier, where you should use sets or maps to represent only one entry for each unique word in the training data. \n\nQ: Why do I get -inf when I compute a natural log?\n\nA: Make sure you are not doing integer division. If you compute log(1 / 3), the division 1 / 3 gets truncated to 0. Instead, cast the divisor or dividend to a double: log(1 / static_cast\u003cdouble\u003e(3)).\n\nQ: How do I record \"For each label L and word w, the number of posts with label L that contain w\"? \n\nA: You'll need a more complex data structure, since you'll need to store three pieces of information - the label, the word, and the count. There are at least two different ways to do this. Hint: The key type and/or value type of a map can be a class.\n\nQ: What's a csvstream and how do I use it? \n\nA: There are three really helpful examples at https://github.com/awdeorio/csvstream.\n\nQ: How fast does my code need to run?\n\nA: You should aim for the large test case to run within a minute or so. For reference, the instructor solution takes about 5 seconds on this test case.\n\nQ: My code is too slow. What might be the reason?\n\nA: Common sources of slowness include:\n\nProcessing a post more than once (including reading it more than once or saving all the data in a vector).\n\nIterating over a map to find something rather than using [] or find().\n\nPassing strings or containers by value.\n\nIterating by value in a range-based for loop.",
