2,"project_for the implementation of card_less, does the rank of the led card matter? or is only the suit important? thanks!","In the game of Euchre, when playing a card during a trick, both the suit and the rank of the led card are significant. Players must follow the suit that was led if they are able to do so, which indicates that suit has a primary role in the gameplay.

If a player cannot follow suit, they may play any card from their hand, including cards of different suits. In this scenario, while the rank of the card played may not influence the legality of play, it can affect the outcome of the trick, depending on the values assigned to the cards within the context of the specific suit.

For Simple Players, who utilize straightforward strategies, the choice of whether to play a card depends first on following suit and then on maximizing their potential to win the trick based on card value. Therefore, the rank of the led card does have importance when it comes to who wins the trick.

### Summary:
- **Suit Importance**: Must follow suit if able.
- **Rank Importance**: Matters when deciding which card to play to win the trick if the player cannot follow suit.

3,"project_Since the ranks and suits of the cards are assigned to an enum data type, is it possible for me to directly access the number of the rank/suit of the card instead of the title? In the function is_face_or_ace, instead of having 4 conditions in the if statement checking if the rank of the card is either king/queen/jack/ace, if I can simply access the number that the rank is assigned to (eg ""JACK"" is assigned the value 9), I can implement a simple if(suit>=9) which would be faster. Is it also possible to do this the other way around, where I implement it like this: if(suit>=JACK) ? Please let me know which of the two methods is correct.  Also, do we have to implement the friend function(friend std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &is, Card &card);)?","In C++, enums allow you to access the underlying integer values that are assigned to each enumerator, and you can indeed use these integer values for comparisons in your functions. Here is how the approach works regarding your query:

### Accessing Rank/Suit as Integers

1. **Using Integer Values in Conditions**: 
   - You can directly compare the rank of a card (if it is represented as an enum) with its underlying integer value. For example, if `JACK` is defined as 9, you can write conditions like `if (rank >= 9)`. This is valid in C++ and should work as you expect.

2. **Using Enums for Comparisons**:
   - You can also use the enumerator's name directly in your conditions. For example, `if (rank >= JACK)` is also valid and often clearer, as it improves readability. This means you can use the enum identifiers in your `if` statements without needing to memorize their corresponding values.

### Correctness of Methods

Both methods are correct:
- Using integer values (like `if(suit >= 9)`) is technically correct but can reduce the readability of your code. It ties your logic directly to specific integer values, which might change if the enum definitions change.
- Using enumerator names (like `if(suit >= JACK)`) is preferable for maintainability and clarity. It represents the intention more clearly and allows you to avoid magic numbers in your code.

### Friend Function Implementation

Regarding the implementation of the friend function `friend std::istream & operator>>(std::istream &is, Card &card);`, you are encouraged to implement this function if it is part of the project requirements. Typically, this function would streamline the process of reading a `Card` object from input streams, allowing for more flexible and simpler input handling. If it’s specified in the project guidelines or your instructor’s notes, it should be included in your implementation to meet the project requirements.

### Summary

In summary, for your `is_face_or_ace` function:
- Using the enum directly for comparisons (e.g., `if (rank >= JACK)`) is the best practice.
- Implementing the friend function is recommended if specified in the project details.

4,"project_Suit Suit_next(Suit suit)  {   return static_cast<Suit>((suit + 2) % 4);  }  In this sample of code, I used static_cast to convert the integer answer of the operation to a suit/enum data type. If I don't use static_cast, then my function doesn't work. Is this because the enum data type of 'suit' is converted to an integer?","Yes, your understanding is correct. In C++, enumerations (enums) like `Suit` are internally represented as integers. When you perform arithmetic operations on an enum value, such as adding an integer to it, the enum is treated as an integer during that operation. However, the result of the arithmetic will still be an integer.

The `static_cast<Suit>` is necessary because, without it, the compiler will treat the result of your operation as an integer. Since the return type of your function is `Suit`, not an integer, you must explicitly convert (cast) the integer result back into the `Suit` enumeration type. This conversion ensures that the function complies with its return type specification.

If you omit `static_cast`, you will encounter a type mismatch error since the function signature specifies that it must return a `Suit`, not an integer. Thus, using `static_cast` confirms that you want to treat the resulting integer as a value of the enum type.

### Key Points:
- Enum types are treated as integers in arithmetic operations.
- Use `static_cast` to convert the integer result back to the enum type to match the function's return type.
- Omitting the cast leads to a compilation error due to type mismatch.

5,"project_Hi, I'm currently writing my Card.cpp and I'm not sure if I should put the operator overrides inside the private/ public/ or entirely outside of the card class. In Card.hpp I saw that there was a copy of the >> operator in private written as a friend function as an example (?) of a possible configuration so I did that with my functions in Card.cpp? I'm not sure if I'm on the right track with that","### Operator Overloading in Card.cpp

When it comes to implementing operator overloads for your class, it's standard practice to include them as **non-member functions** or as **friend functions** within the class definition. This approach allows the overloads to access private members of the class, if necessary.

In your case, since you mentioned that you've declared an operator (like `>>`) as a friend function in `Card.hpp`, you're on the right track. Friend functions can access private members of the class directly, which is useful for I/O operations. Here's a brief outline of how you can structure your operator overloads:

1. **Declaration in Header (Card.hpp)**: 
   - Declare your operator overloads as friend functions. This allows them to access private members without being part of the class itself.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     class Card {
     public:
         // Other public methods...
         friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Card& card);
         friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, Card& card);

     private:
         // Private attributes...
     };
     ```

2. **Implementation in Source (Card.cpp)**:
   - Define your operator overloads outside the class, typically in the corresponding .cpp file.
   - This keeps the operator logic separate from the class definition, which can help with readability and maintainability.
   - Example:
     ```cpp
     std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Card& card) {
         // Implementation...
         return os;
     }

     std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, Card& card) {
         // Implementation...
         return is;
     }
     ```

### Conclusion

By following the above structure, you'll maintain a clean separation between your class definition and the operator overload implementations, while still providing the necessary access privileges through friendship. This approach enhances code readability and adheres to common C++ practices.

6,"project_working on the human player and have found the excerpt on always ensuring the hand of a human player is sorted. is this also applicable to the simple player? if not, is it actively harmful to do so to the simple player (if the autograder would not accept sorted simple player hands as correct)? thanks!","In the context of the Euchre game, the implementation details specify that for a Human Player, the cards in their hand must always be kept in sorted order. This is crucial for consistency with the autograder test cases, which expect the output to reflect this ordering.

For the Simple Player, it is implied that a different strategy may apply. The Simple Player's strategy, as described, considers only the suit that was led when choosing which card to play, and does not involve complex calculations or considerations like sorting. Therefore, actively sorting the Simple Player's hand may not be necessary and could potentially be seen as introducing unnecessary complexity.

### Conclusion:
1. **Sorting Requirement**: The sorting of a Human Player's hand is necessary for standardization with the game's expected output, especially for autograder tests.
2. **Simple Player's Hand**: Sorting the Simple Player's hand is not explicitly required and may not align with the expected behavior during gameplay.
3. **Potential Harm**: If the autograder does not expect the Simple Player's hand to be sorted, providing a sorted hand could result in incorrect evaluations or failures in tests designed for the Simple Player's straightforward strategy.

Therefore, it would be advisable to maintain the simplicity of the Simple Player's implementation and refrain from unnecessary sorting to avoid any negative impacts on its evaluation by the autograder.

It is also suggested to follow style guidelines and thoughtfully design the game logic, which indirectly assists in identifying potential bugs during implementation and testing. If tests fail, it indicates that there may be issues in the code that need to be addressed, serving as a feedback mechanism during the debugging process.

Since there is no variable that stores the name or the hand in Player.hpp, the debugger can't show the name or the hand of any of the players and I was wondering how I can see/access those things in the debugger.","To see what cards each player has in their hand while debugging the Euchre game, you'll need to implement additional functionality in your `Player` class. Here's a general approach to achieve this:

### Implementing Hand Visibility

1. **Add Member Variables:**
   First, ensure that the `Player` class (or its derived classes like `HumanPlayer`, `SimplePlayer`) has a member variable that stores the player's hand. This could be a container like `std::vector<Card>` to hold the cards.

   ```cpp
   class Player {
   protected:
       std::vector<Card> hand; // To store the player's hand of cards.
   public:
       // Methods to manipulate the hand
       void addCard(const Card& card) {
           hand.push_back(card);
       }
       const std::vector<Card>& getHand() const {
           return hand;
       }
   };
   ```

2. **Display Function:**
   Implement a method within the `Player` class to display the cards in the player's hand. This can be a simple function that iterates over the `hand` vector and prints each card.

   ```cpp
   void printHand() const {
       for (const auto& card : hand) {
           std::cout << card << "" ""; // Assuming the Card class has an operator<< overloaded
       }
       std::cout << std::endl;
   }
   ```

3. **Integration with Debugger:**
   Ensure that the debugging environment you are using is set up to evaluate expressions or call methods on objects. You should be able to call `printHand()` or examine the `hand` member variable directly in your debugger, depending on your IDE's capabilities.

4. **Call `printHand()`:**
   You can call this function at strategic points in your game flow, such as after cards are dealt or when a player is about to play their card. This will allow you to see the contents of each player's hand at runtime.

### Using the Debugger

- Depending on your development environment, you can place breakpoints in the relevant parts of your code where you need to check the players' hands. While debugging, you can step through the code and check the `hand` variable for each player or call `printHand()` to view the hand contents directly in the output.

By incorporating these changes, you will enhance your ability to review player hands during debugging sessions without relying solely on the `pack.in` file. 

### Final Note
Make sure to test the modified code to ensure that the player hands are handled correctly without introducing errors in the game logic.

This allows you to maintain state information necessary for the players to function correctly within the game.

### Structure of Player Classes

1. **Header File Declarations (`Player.hpp`)**:
   - You should declare both the SimplePlayer and HumanPlayer classes in the `Player.hpp` file. This includes defining the class structures, member functions, and any necessary member variables.
   - For example:
     ```cpp
     class SimplePlayer : public Player {
     private:
         std::string name;  // private variable to store player's name
         // Additional member variables as needed
     public:
         SimplePlayer(const std::string &name);  // constructor
         void play(/* parameters */);  // function declaration
         // Other function declarations as required
     };
     ```

2. **Implementation in the Source File (`Player.cpp`)**:
   - The actual implementation of the functions should be in the `Player.cpp` file. This file will include the corresponding header file and define how each function behaves.
   - For example:
     ```cpp
     #include ""Player.hpp""  // include the header file for class definitions

     SimplePlayer::SimplePlayer(const std::string &name) {
         this->name = name;  // initialization
     }

     void SimplePlayer::play(/* parameters */) {
         // Implementation of the play function
     }
     ```

### Summary

- **Declarations** for class members and methods are placed in the header file (`Player.hpp`).
- **Implementations** of those methods go into the corresponding source file (`Player.cpp`).
- Creating your own private member variables in the derived classes is necessary to maintain state specific to each player.

This structure ensures that your classes are well-organized and leverage the principles of object-oriented programming effectively.

In the context of programming and particularly in object-oriented designs, an invariants function typically ensures that certain conditions or properties hold true throughout the lifecycle of an object.

If your project involves a card game like Euchre, an invariants function might be used to check the validity of the game state, the properties of the cards, players' hands, or the overall game setup. 

The specific implementation details would depend on the requirements outlined in your project instructions. It’s best to refer to the project guidelines or specifications to clarify if an invariants function is explicitly required and what conditions it should enforce. 

If there's no direct mention of an invariants function in your documentation, you may want to consider whether the core concepts of invariants apply to the classes and state you are managing.

Code 1: bool Pack::empty() const  {   return (next == PACK_SIZE);  }","Your implementation of the `Pack::empty()` function seems logically correct. It checks if the `next` index is equal to `PACK_SIZE`, which implies that the pack is empty if the index has reached the size of the pack. However, let’s clarify a few points:

1. **Understanding `PACK_SIZE`:** Ensure that `PACK_SIZE` is defined correctly as the total number of cards in your pack (for example, 24 for a Euchre game).
2. **Empty Condition:** The condition you are using compares `next` with `PACK_SIZE`. This would indicate that the pack is empty when `next` has not yet been used to point to any cards, provided that `next` increments properly as cards are added.
3. **Initialization of `next`:** If you intend for `next` to represent the next available index, it should indeed be initialized to `0` when you first create the pack, allowing subsequent increments to represent how many cards have been added.

A possible initialization in the constructor might look like this:

```cpp
Pack::Pack() : next(0) { /* other initializations if necessary */ }
```

Make sure to check where and how you modify `next` throughout your code to ensure it aligns with your intended logic for handling a full or empty pack.

### Summary
- Your `empty()` function correctly checks for an empty pack.
- Ensure proper initialization of `next` to allow correct behavior.

14,"project_So for this part, the specs say this: ""If a Human Player is the dealer and someone orders up during the first round of making, the Human Player will pick up the upcard and discard a card of their choice.

So are we suppose to check if the human player is dealer and those conditions in player.cpp or that is the euchre.cpp part?","The logic for determining whether a Human Player is the dealer and managing the interactions during the making phase, including picking up the upcard and discarding a card, should ideally be handled in the `euchre.cpp` file. The `Game` class, which you would implement in this file, should manage the overall gameplay flow, including player roles and actions during different phases of the game.

Here's how you might approach it:

1. **Check the Dealer**: During the making trump phase, check if the Human Player (the dealer) is the one executing the action.
2. **Update Game State**: If a player orders up, you can then allow the Human Player to pick up the upcard and prompt them to discard a card. This interaction is part of gameplay management, which fits well within the responsibilities of your `Game` class in `euchre.cpp`.

The `Player.cpp` file should primarily focus on the behaviors and capabilities of player classes, such as how they make decisions or interact with the game. Therefore, the specifics of the game flow and the trading of cards are better placed in `euchre.cpp`.

### Summary
- Check for dealer conditions and manage the pick-up/discard actions in `euchre.cpp`.
- Implement player behaviors separately in `Player.cpp`.

This separation of concerns will help maintain clarity and structure in your code.

15,project_I created a string private member variable for the player's name for the simple player class in player.cpp. When I'm running my public tests. I'm getting a segmentation fault 11. I'm not sure why since the parameters for the base class and the derived class are matching.  My latest submission is on the Autograder. Thank you!,"A segmentation fault often indicates that your program is trying to access memory that it shouldn't or is dereferencing a null or invalid pointer. Since you've mentioned that the parameters for the base class and derived class are matching, here are a few potential causes and troubleshooting steps to consider for your Simple Player class:

### 1. Check Memory Allocation
Ensure that when you create an instance of the `SimplePlayer`, you're correctly allocating memory if you're using dynamic allocation. If you're using `new`, ensure that you're properly managing that memory throughout your class.

### 2. Constructor Initialization
Verify that the constructor for your `SimplePlayer` class properly initializes the private member variable (the player's name). This should be done using an initializer list or within your constructor body.

Example:
```c++
SimplePlayer::SimplePlayer(const std::string &name) : Player(name), name(name) {
  // Additional initialization if needed
}
```

### 3. Ensure Correctness in Player Factory
If you're using a factory function to create `SimplePlayer` instances, ensure that it correctly implements the logic to create and return an instance of `SimplePlayer`. Double-check that you aren’t returning a null pointer, which could lead to dereferencing issues.

Example of a factory function:
```c++
Player* Player_factory(const std::string &name, const std::string &strategy) {
  if (strategy == ""Simple"") {
    return new SimplePlayer(name);
  }
  // Handle other strategies or return nullptr
}
```

### 4. Check Your Public Tests
Review the specific tests in your `Player_public_tests.cpp`. Sometimes test conditions may assume specific states or values from the object being tested. Ensure that your objects are being properly instantiated and that no invalid states can be reached during these tests.

### 5. Debugging
- Use debugging tools or print statements to trace the flow of execution leading up to the segmentation fault.
- Print out values of your internal variables immediately before the trouble spot to see if they contain unexpected values.

### 6. Code Review
Review your code for other common issues that might lead to segmentation faults, such as:
- Out-of-bounds access on arrays or vectors.
- Improper use of pointers that may lead to dereferencing null pointers.

### Conclusion
If you've done all of the above and are still experiencing issues, consider seeking feedback from classmates or your instructor regarding your implementation. You can also check the Autograder logs for any additional information about the failures.

16,project_Not sure how to write the one that takes in the led card without copying code from the other.,"### Implementing a Method to Handle the Led Card in the Euchre Game

To write a method that processes the led card without copying code from other parts, you need to follow the principles of object-oriented programming, particularly encapsulation and reusability. Here’s a suggested approach to implement this function:

1. **Define Your Class Structure**: Make sure the method resides in the appropriate class. If your game has a `Player` class or a `Game` class, add the method there. For instance, if you have a function to play a trick, it might belong in the `Game` class.

2. **Use Member Functions**: Instead of duplicating code that handles card playing or decision-making, create separate member functions (if not already present) that can be reused. This supports the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

3. **Pass the Led Card as a Parameter**: When defining your method, include parameters that allow the method to take the led card as input without needing to reference the card directly.

   ```cpp
   void playTrick(Card ledCard);
   ```

4. **Implement Logic Using the Led Card**: In your method, implement logic that interacts with the led card. For example, determine how the player reacts based on the led card’s suit and rank. Make sure to differentiate the behavior if the player has the ability to follow suit.

   ```cpp
   void Player::playTrick(Card ledCard) {
       // Logic to decide how to respond to the led card
       if (canFollowSuit(ledCard)) {
           Card cardToPlay = highestCardOfSuit(ledCard.getSuit());
           playCard(cardToPlay);
       } else {
           Card cardToPlay = lowestCardInHand();
           playCard(cardToPlay);
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Testing Your Method**: Ensure that your new method is tested separately. Create tests that verify the correct behavior when different led cards are played. Refer to your existing test frameworks for classes such as `Player_tests.cpp`.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you can implement a functionality that interacts with the led card effectively while promoting code reuse and maintainability. Make sure to fully utilize your class design to keep your code organized and modular.

It appears you are facing two distinct issues related to your implementation of `euchre.cpp`: failing public tests for the `Pack` class and undefined behavior (UB) checks with the Address Sanitizer.

1. **Running on CAEN for Pack Testing**: 
   If your public tests are passing on your local setup but failing on the autograder, it may be beneficial to run tests on the CAEN (Computing and Information Technology) environment. The configuration there might differ from your WSL setup and could help identify if the issue lies with your local environment. Additionally, running your tests in a controlled environment that mirrors the autograder can ensure consistency in results.

2. **Using Assert Statements**: 
   Adding assert statements can certainly help check if the required conditions for the return mode of a function are met. By incorporating these assertions, you can validate assumptions in your code and catch issues before they lead to UB. This may help narrow down potential sources of UB by ensuring preconditions and postconditions are satisfied.

### Additional Recommendations 

- **Review Error Messages**: Pay close attention to the Address Sanitizer error messages. They can provide you with hints about what might be going wrong, including memory overflows, use-after-free errors, or improper memory accesses.
  
- **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough review of your code, particularly areas handling dynamic memory allocation. Ensure that all memory allocated is properly managed, and check for potential logical errors that might not surface directly during regular operation.

- **Input Validation**: Make sure all inputs to your functions are validated. This includes checking for null pointers and ensuring your pack is correctly initialized before use.

- **Simplify Test Cases**: Try reducing your test cases to the simplest form. If a test case is complex, isolating specific features of your implementation can help in tracing back errors.

If you require more tailored advice based on specific error messages or scenarios, feel free to provide additional context.

18,"project_Should the operator overloads take into account both suit and rank or just rank?    bool operator<(const Card &lhs, const Card &rhs);  bool operator>(const Card &lhs, const Card &rhs);","When overloading operators for comparing playing cards in the context of the Euchre game, it is essential to take into account both the **rank** and the **suit** of the cards. The general approach is as follows:

1. **Rank Comparison**: The primary comparison should be based on the rank of the cards. The rank determines which card is higher in value.
2. **Suit as a Tiebreaker**: If two cards have the same rank (e.g., two Jacks), the suit should be used to break the tie, ensuring that the game's rules are followed correctly. Typically, this means that cards of certain suits (like trump suits) might take precedence over others.

Using these criteria would look something like this in the implementation:

```cpp
bool operator<(const Card &lhs, const Card &rhs) {
    if (lhs.get_rank() != rhs.get_rank()) {
        return lhs.get_rank() < rhs.get_rank();
    }
    // If ranks are equal, compare suits
    return lhs.get_suit() < rhs.get_suit();
}

bool operator>(const Card &lhs, const Card &rhs) {
    if (lhs.get_rank() != rhs.get_rank()) {
        return lhs.get_rank() > rhs.get_rank();
    }
    // If ranks are equal, compare suits
    return lhs.get_suit() > rhs.get_suit();
}
```

This implementation first compares the ranks, and if they are equal, it then compares the suits. Ensure to follow the game's specific conventions on suit ordering (e.g., trump suit vs. non-trump suit) when implementing this logic.

19,project_How do I make sure in round 2 of making trump that the dealer makes trump if everyone else passes?,"To ensure the dealer makes trump in round 2 of making trump when all other players pass, you need to implement the following steps in your code:

1. **Track Passes**: During the first round of making trump, you'll need to track whether every player passes. If all players pass, initiate the second round.

2. **Second Round Logic**: In the second round, the upcard's suit from the first round cannot be ordered up. Instead, you will allow players to order up any suit except for the upcard's suit.

3. **Dealer Requirement**: Introduce a rule where if the making trump reaches the dealer and they are faced with the situation where everyone has passed, they must select a trump suit other than the upcard's suit. This rule can be implemented as part of your game logic for the making trump function.

4. **User Input**: When it is the dealer's turn during the second round, allow the dealer to select a suit that is neither the upcard's suit nor to pass.

5. **Game Play Continuation**: Once the dealer makes their choice, proceed with the game using the selected trump suit.

This implementation ensures that the dealer is compelled to make a decision to order up a trump suit if all players, including themself, have declined to choose the upcard in the first round.

Make sure you handle inputs and errors accordingly, particularly for proper validation of the dealer's choice to ensure it adheres to the game's rules.

Comprehensive testing ensures that all functionalities operate correctly and maintain the expected behavior of the Card class.

### Key Points
- **Functionality Coverage:** Each function within `Card.cpp`, including those related to operator overloading, should be tested to validate their accuracy.
- **Testing Importance:** Thorough tests help identify any issues or bugs in the implementation, facilitating a more robust code quality.

### Recommendations
- Implement unit tests that specifically check various scenarios for each function.
- Ensure that edge cases, default and invalid inputs, and all expected behaviors are adequately tested.

Ensuring detailed coverage of these aspects will contribute significantly to the reliability of your code and ease potential debugging steps.

21,project_How do I empty each player's hand at the beginning of each round?,"To empty each player's hand at the beginning of each round in the Euchre game, you can follow these guidelines:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Identify Player Object**: Ensure you have access to the player objects that represent each participant in the game.

2. **Emptying the Hand**: You can use the appropriate method to clear out the hand of each player. This typically involves either resetting the hand vector (assuming you are using a vector to store the cards) or reinitializing it.

3. **Implementation Example**: In your `Game` class's private member functions or within the `play_hand()` function, iterate through each player and clear their hand. Assuming you have a vector `players` that holds pointers to the player instances and a member function `clear_hand()` in the player class, it would look something like this:

    ```cpp
    void Game::play_hand() {
        for (size_t i = 0; i < players.size(); ++i) {
            players[i]->clear_hand();  // Clear each player's hand
        }
        // Additional logic for the new round...
    }
    ```

### Considerations
- You must ensure that the `clear_hand()` method is properly defined in the Player class to clear out the hand correctly, potentially like this:

    ```cpp
    void Player::clear_hand() {
        hand.clear();  // Assuming hand is a vector of Card instances.
    }
    ```

- Use this approach at the start of each round to reset players' hands, just before dealing new cards.

By following this procedure, each player's hand will be emptied, allowing for a fresh start for the next round.

23,"project_For each hang of a game, do we reshuffle the cards, or keep it the way it is after the first time we shuffle it?","In the context of the Euchre Game, whether to reshuffle the cards after each hand depends on the specified game setup. The `shuffle argument` indicates whether the deck should be shuffled or not and accepts values such as 'shuffle' or 'noshuffle'. If the 'shuffle' option is set for the game, the cards would be shuffled at the beginning, but it isn't explicitly noted in the provided information whether they are reshuffled after every hand.

Therefore, it's essential to determine the game's rules applied in your specific context. If the initial setup does not specify reshuffling after subsequent hands, it is likely that the cards remain in the state they were after the first shuffle.
